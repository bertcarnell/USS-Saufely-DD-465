                <div class="row">
                    <p>1.  The USS SAUFLEY in company with Task Unit 31.5.2
                    was engaged in covering the first echelon of LOIs landing at
                    BARAKONA, VELLA LAVELLA, in accordance with Commander Task Force
                    THIRTY-ONE'S Operation Order A12-43. The Task Unit arrived at
                    BARAKOMA at 0710, August 15, and LCIs commenced unloading. The
                    SAUFLEY proceeded to WILSON STRAIT to assume radar guard. Own
                    fighters were providing air coverage during operation. At 0753
                    bogies were picked up on SC radar coming in from northwest. At
                    0000 Japenese dive bombers dove on landing area and were taken
                    under fire by destroyers in landing area. Planes appeared aimiler
                    to Aichi 99's. Five inch antiaircraft fire appeared to be heavy
                    but dispersed. Own fighters followed dive bombers through anti-
                    aircraft fire.</p>
                    <p>2.  One dive bomber going low over southern tip of
                    VELLA LAVELLA was seen to go down in flames after a fighter dove
                    on it. Another was seen heading up WILSON STRAIT with 4 or 5
                    of our fighters diving on him. SAUFLEY did not fire as none of
                    the
                    Japanese planes needed for ship and fighters seemed to have the
                    situation well under control.</p>
                    <p>3.  At 0910 the LOIS completed unloading and the Task
                    Unit proceeded at 12 knots for GUADALGANAL, destroyers screening
                    ahead.</p>
                    <p>4.  At 2048, while southeast of VANGUNU ISLAND, the
                    SAUFLEY had an so radar contact bearing 300°(T), range 15 miles,
                    range decreasing rapidly. Contact was reported to Commander Task
                    Unit and ship went to full general quarters. SG radar picked up
                    the contact at 13000 yards indicating the planes were flying very
                    low. FD radar picked up planes at 7000 yards. SAUFLEY was screening 
                    on starboard bow of ICIs at this time.</p>
                    <p>5.  Two planes were aighted coming in satern of the
                    formation after passing over the PHILIP at sn altitude of about
                    150 feet. Fire of 5" battery was withheld because planes were
                    so low and own oh ips were between us and the target. One plane
                    banked sharply and passed about 100 yards estern of th is ship
                    flashing a signal light as if to challenge. The other plane contimed 
                    over the formation, decreasing altitude to about 50 feet
                    and was seen to drop 6 torpedo close to the WALLER. This plane
                    then circled to the right and passed abeara about 1000 yerds and
                    was taken under fire with the main battery. Dursts were low and
                    estern of the plane. The signal light of the first plano caused
                    some confusion as to whether or not the planes were friendly and
                    for this reason the 4Cmm did not open fire. The planes were
                    later identified as Mitsubishi type 97 as it was B clear moonlight
                    night with excellent visibility.</p>
                    <p>6.  On the second attack about 2103 a low flying plane
                    ploked up by the SG rader came in and passed about 300 yards satern
                    of the ship heading across the formation and was taken under fire
                    by SAUFLEY 4.cmm. As the plane crossed the formation the PHILIP
                    took the plane under fire with her 40mm and it was seen to disappear 
                    in a streak of 40mm tracers followed by a dull red flash.</p>
                    <p>7.  On the third attack about 2108 a low flying plane
                    was picked up by SG rader on the port bow at a range of about 5000
                    yards and was taken under fire with the main battery.</p>
                    <p>8.  About 2000, before the attack developed, a snooper
                    plane had trailed the formation keeping at a range of about 10
                    miles. This together with the fact that the planes making the
                    attacks made steedy bearing approach from 15 miles seems to indieste 
                    the snooper was used to direct the attack.</p>
                    <p>9.  It is estimated that from four to six planes took
                    part in the attack although only two were seen at a time. Four
                    to five separate attacks were made, all from the northwest, the
                    destroyers being their main targets. A total of six underweter
                    explosions were heard and felt although no damage was done.</p>
                    <p>10.  The total ammunition expended on the three attacks
                    within gun range was 8 rounds antiaircraft common, 32 rounde Mark
                    32 projectiles and 12 rounds of 40mm with no observed hits.</p>

                    <div><u>PART I</u></div>
        
                    <p>A.  The period covered by this report includes the sortie
                    from Zanboanga, Mindanao by the Basilan Attack Unit to the landing
                    boach on Basilan Island on 16 March 1945.</p>
                    <p>B.  The USS SAUFLEY's participation in this operation
                    consisted of providing the prearranged initial bolbardment, and
                    action as the covering force for the other units involved while
                    being available for call-fire support.</p>
                    
                    <div><u>PART II</u></div>
                    
                    <p>A.  SAUFLEY was ordered to anchor in Santa Cruz Bank
                    the morning of 16 March and the commanding officer to report at
                    about 0700 to Commander Task Unit SEVENTY EIGHT POINT ONE POINT
                    TWO (Commander Destroyer Squadron TWENTY TWO) for a conference
                    preliminary to the operation at hand. During the conference the
                    Officer in Tactical Command explained the details of the landing.
                    The USS SAUFLEY was underway at 0845 and joined Commander Task
                    Unit SEVENTY EIGHT POINT ONE POINT TWO in the USS WALLER, proceeding
                    to the objective area at maximum speed to meet the bombardment
                    schedule which was noved ahead twenty (20) minutes to make up for
                    lack of air bombardment.</p>
                    <p>B.  The SAUFLEY operated with the destroyor support unit
                    which consisted of the USS WALLER (F), USS ROBINSON and USS SAUFLEY
                    under the connand of Captain R. H. SMITH, Commander Destroyer
                    Squadron TWENTY TWO (Officer in Tactical Connand).</p>
                    <p>C.  SAUFLEY's targets for the initial prearranged bonbardment
                    prior to the landing were Lanitan Town and Luajon Hill on Basilan
                    Island.</p>
                    <p>D.  Own forces consisted of the destroyer support unit,
                    the LCS support unit, the control units, and the small landing
                    force. Motor Torpodo Boats were operating in the area but
                    instructed to remain clear of tho objective area.</p>
                    <p>E.  No enery forces were encountered.</p>
        
                    <div><u>PART III</u></div>
        
                    <p>The chronological account of the action follows. All times
                    are zone (-9) times; all bearings are true. The sky was clear and
                    weather in general favored the operation. A moderate Southeasterly
                    wind was deflected away from the objective area by the island itself. 
                    The SAUFLEY maintained Condition of Readiness I and Material
                    Condition Able until the completion of the firing when Condition
                    of Readiness I - Easy was set and material Condition blowas modified

                        125° relative. All ships in the Division were scheduled to
                        fire on target Able. The SAUFLEY commenced firing at 2339 (I)
                        with the range 9050 yards and bearing 013.5 true and ceased
                        firing at 2346(I) at a range 7750 yards and bearing 0409 true.
                        Results were not observed due to poor visibility. No counter
                        battery fire was encountered. Ammunition expended, 120 rounds
                        AA Common.</p>
                    <p>Course was changed to 2600 true and at 2352 (I)
                        the SAUFLEY commenced firing on assigned target Easy, three
                        gun emplacements and supply dump, at a range of 16,250 yards,
                        bearing 351 true. Fired eight five gun salvos with results
                        unobserved. After turning south and making a new approach
                        SAUFLEY commenced firing at 0022 (I) on target Fox, enemy barge
                        hideout. Fired four five gun salvos at range 12,250 yards,
                        bearing 334 true. Another approach was made and three five
                        gun salvos were fired on same target at 0037 (I) at a range of
                        9050 yards, bearing 348° true, with results unobserved.</p>
                    <p>Upon completion of bombardment mission the
                        Division made a sweep to westward in the Camotes Sea. A PBY
                        on patrol had reported an enemy submarine approaching Ormoc
                        Bay at 2315(I) in Latitude 10-33' North, Longitude 124-25'
                        East, on course 045 true, speed 12.0 knots. On returning to
                        Ormoc Bay the RENSHAW reported a surface target bearing 149
                        true at a range of 15,000 yards from her. At 0125 (I) the
                        SAUFLEY picked up same target at a range of 11,500 yards and
                        commenced coaching the main battery on the target. The
                        RENSHAW commenced firing first and the SAUFLEY second at
                        0132(I) at a range of 5,800 yards, bearing 142 true.</p>
                    <p>The submarine was undoubtedly surprised as
                        he was maneuvering radically with a speed of about six
                        knots. Starshell illumination was ordered and after good
                        illumination the main battery shifted to optical control at
                        a range of about 4000 yards as the radars were unable to
                        distinguish the target from the numerous splashes of all ships
                        firing at close ranges. The Division changed course to south
                        and it appeared that the USS WALLER was going to ram the submarine. 
                        All ships commenced firing their 40MM guns. Numerous
                        hits were seen on the submarine but the submarine crew was
                        still firing back with their 3" and machine guns. The WALLER
                        did not ram but passed close aboard to starboard circling the
                        submarine. All ships ceased firing. Shortly after the WATLER
                        circled the submarine the Division Commander reported the
                        submarine sunk, stern first, and stopped to try to pick up
                        survivors. From the SAUFLEY we observed several survivors in the
                        water plus a small amount of unrecognizable debris. Ammunition
                        expended was 245 rounds AA Common, 6 Starshells and 60 rounds
                        40MM.</p>
                    <p>Communications were good except for occasional
                        rain static. The submarine reported by the PBY at 2315 (I) was
                        sunk by Destroyer Division FORTY THREE at about 0144(I) in
                        approximately Latitude 10°-48' N, Longitude 124° - 35'E. This
                        seems to be an exceptional feat of rapid communications in
                        addition to close coordination of all units concerned as only
                        2.5 hours elapsed between the reporting and sinking of the
                        submarine. Navigation was accomplished entirely by radar.
                        The bombardments were conducted by coaching the director on
                        target from navigational fixes and the dead reckoning tracer.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to note that, during the
                        firing on the submarine, spotting could have been effected by
                        means of the SG PPI, as definite indications of at least six
                        straddles were observed around the targets echo. Between the
                        times of firing at target Able and target Easy an echo appeared
                        on the SG radar, having previously been reported by the USS RENSHAW.
                        The SAUFLEY prepared to take this target under fire but upon
                        tracking found the radar ranges and bearings to be extremely
                        variable. No dead reckoning tracer or computer track could be
                        obtained and the target finally disappeared from all radar
                        screens. It is believed that this was a phantom radar target.</p>
                    <p>No casualties to personnel or material were
                        experienced and both performed in an excellent manner.

                    <p>2.  On the night of 27 - 28 November 1944 the subject
                        bombardment mission was marked by the successful attack upon an
                        enemy submarine by destroyers assigned to the mission.</p>
                    <p>3.  Contact with the submarine was made by one of our
                        patrol planes at 2315/I, in Latitude 10°-31'N, Longitude 124°-
                        25'E. The destroyers were directed to the target and after a
                        surface action sank the submarine at about 0144/I in Latitude
                        10°-48'N, Longitude 124°-35'E.</p>
                    <p>4.  This excellent cooperation between air and surface
                        units, which resulted in destruction of the enemy submarine
                        within two and one half hours after contact, is noted with approval.</p>
                    <p>5.  By copy of this endorsement Command er Task Force
                        Seventy-Three is requested to commend the pilot and crew of the

                    <p>1.  The SAUFLEY in company with Task Group 31.6 was
                        engaged in escorting and providing coverage to landing operations
                        at BARAKOMA, Vella Lavella from 16 - 19 August in accordance
                        with Commander Task Force THIRTY-ONE'S Operation Order A12-43.
                        Fighter director unit from GUADAICANAL was aboard during these
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>2.  Bogies were picked up at 1900 on the 16th while
                        the SAUFLEY in company with the WALLER and PHILIP was proceeding
                        to rendezvous with 1ST's off the RUSSEL ISLANDS. At 1910 commenced firing 5" battery while off CAFE ESPERENCE, GUADALOANAL.
                        No results were observed. Contact considered doubtful. During
                        the night bogies were frequently reported but none came within
                        gun range.</p>
                    <p>3.  At 1850 on the 17th SC radar reported bogies 39
                        miles ecming in from west of VELLA LAVELLA. At this time LST's
                        were unloading on beach at BARAKOMA and destroyers were patrolling 
                        off shore. At 1910 several bombs landed on beach near LST's
                        and LST's opened up with 20mm's. No results were observed. LST's
                        then got underway and the task group proceeded down GIZO STRAIT
                        at 9 knots, destroyers patrolling at 30 knots, laying smoke
                        screens to cover LST'S. At 2142 & plane cane in low over the
                        formation at high speed. Only the flames from his exhaust could
                        be seen and all ships opened up with 40 and 20mm's. The plane
                        seemed to be encompassed by tracers but he apparently WELB not
                        badly damaged. At 2144 commenced firing 5" and 40mm's at plane
                        flying low down our port side at a range of about 1000 yards or
                        less. Again no results were observed and only his exhaust could
                        be seen. At 2245 the WALLER and PHILIP had collision. At 2347
                        stopped smoke. During the above period there were bogies on the
                        screen almost continuously. Only the ones which made close
                        approaches have been listed.</p>
                    <p>4.  At 2345 the SAUFLEY and PHILIP left Task Group
                        THIRTY-ONE POINT STX to join Destroyer Division FORTY-ONE off
                        KOIONDANGARA end intercept four enemy destroyers and several
                        barges. While proceeding through GIZO STRAIT at 34 knote an
                        enemy plane was dropping green and white signal flares about 5
                        miles ahead. At 0026 on the 18th, Commander Destroyer Division
                        FORTY-ONE was contacted by TBS and the SAUFLEY and PHILIP ordered
                        to return to Task Group THIRTY-ONE POINT SIX. The SAULLEY and
                        PHILIP rejoined as 0155 and the Task Group changed course for
                        VELLA LAVELLA at 0207. At 0221 a fire was seen to break out on
                        LST 396. The fire spread quickly followed by several small
                        explosions. Personal and life rafts were seen in the water. A
                        landing boat was also seen in the water. The SAUFLEY elosed to
                        about 700 yards and lowered a boat and nots to recover survivors.
                        During this time several bogies were in the area and were taken
                        under fire by the WALLER. The flames illuminated the SAUFLEY and
                        entire area. At 0235 a tremendous explosion throw debris near this
                        ship. The LST sank at 0300, the SAUFLEY having recovered 93 survivors 
                        including 10 officers. SC 1266 also recovered 10 survivors.
                        A thorough search was then made of the area for additional survivors.
                        At 0408 the SAUFLEY proceeded to rejoin the Task Unit.</p>
                    <p>5.  At 0520 the SAUFLEY returned to cover SO 1266 which
                        was reported being attacked by aircraft. No further bogies came
                        within gun range. At 0715 the SAUFLEY arrived at BARAKOMA and commenced 
                        patrolling area while LST'S unloaded. At 0740 so redar reported 
                        bogie at 60 miles. At 0743 bombs were seen landing on beach
                        near LST's and dive bombers were seen pulling out of their dives.
                        Almost immediately dive bombers were seen diving on this mhip from
                        out of the sun. They were taken under fire by the 40mm's and 20mm's.
                        Two bombs, apparently 500 pounds, landed about 15 - 20 yards from
                        ship on starboard side, one by gun 12, the other well aft. ship
                        was being maneuvered radically, at the time, at 32 knots, about 3
                        to 5 miles off shore. Planes were taken under fire by 5" battery
                        after they had pulled out of dive. Later a plane approached from
                        the north coming in low along the coast of VEILA LAVELLA. This
                        was taken under fire by 5" battery and seen crash just off shore
                        about 3 miles north of BARAKOMA. Flanes were identified as Aichi
                        99's. Another plane was seen smoking as it disappeared to westward
                        low over the hills of VELLA LAVELLA. This plane was reported to
                        be an F4U by the WALLER. A parachute was seen to land near the
                        beach shortly afterwards. 20mm gunners report hitting one of
                        the previous group of dive bombers coming out of his dive and
                        seeing him crash by southern tip of VELLA LAVELLA. The planes
                        pulled out of their dives at between 400 and 1000 feet. About
                        8 - 10 planes participated in the raid.</p>
                    <p>6.  At 0855 Commander Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-TWO
                        came aboard and the WAILER departed as bow damage from collision
                        limited her to 20 knots. At 1150 so reder reported bogies at 11
                        miles but they did not come in.</p>
                    <p>7.  At 1305 weather closed in and own fighter planes
                        returned to MUNDA. At 1437 radar reported a large group of
                        planes distance 27 miles, northwest of VELLA LAVELLA and SAUFLEY
                        commenced laying smoke screen at 30 knote in case of torgedo
                        plane attack. Planes did not cose in however, probably because
                        of low ceiling over VELLA LAVELLA. At 1546 bombs were seen to
                        land very near PHILIP and a plane diving on SAUFLEY wes taken
                        under fire by 20mm's and 40mm's. It is believed that it was
                        hit in Give as it was thrown off its dive and began trailing
                        smoke. Three bombs apparently one 500 pound and two 100 sound
                        fell 300 yards off fantail. The plane pulled out of its dive
                        and was taken under fire by the 5" battery also. 20mm's and 40mm's
                        appeared to be close. The plane was losing altitude end appeared
                        to be in trouble since it did not maneuver. Shortly after,
                        fighter coverage arrived and reported seeing the plane burning
                        near south shore of KOLOMBANGARA. The please was an Aichi 99.</p>
                    <p>8.  At 1600 the 40mm's opened fire on three planes coming 
                        in from southward low over hills of VELLA LAVELLA in a close
                        formation. Range about 3000 yards. The 5" bettery opened fire
                        shortly afterwards. One plane was seen to fall and the other
                        two turned and headed back overland. The 40mm gunners report
                        that there were four planes in the group and that two of them
                        went down.</p>
                    <p>9.  At 1845 lookout reported 9 planes caming in low
                        from GIZO ISLAND. Planes were never seen from bridge. Fighter
                        director recalled four F4U's to give air coverage. Those planes
                        were low on gas and on way to MUNDA but they returned and circled
                        formation at 1500 feet. Torpodo planes, if in vicinity, never
                        came in. At 2330 and again at 0230 on the 19th, SC redar reported
                        bogies in vicinity but they never came within gun range. On
                        each occasion screening destroyers laid heavy smoke screen around
                        LST's at 25 knots. During these att seks a total of 424 rounds of
                        5"/38 caliber antiaircraft common, with NK. XVIII Mode. 2 and 3
                        Tuzes, soo rounds of 40mm, and 1600 rounds of 20mm was expended.</p>
                    <p>10.  The ship was at modified general quarters during the
                        entire operation, going to full general quarters each time bogies
                        were picked up on radar or reported by other ships. The nights
                        were clear and moonlight except for the time between sunset and
                        moonrise, which was about frem 1830 to 2000. on the 17th and,
                        morning of the 18th the aky was 50% overeast with cloud formations
                        giving ideal coverage to dive bombers.</p>

                    screening ship in column with orders to fire at targets of opportunity. 
                    At 0309 Love commenced firing on flashes apperently
                    from a light and heavy anti-aircraft battery about one thousand
                    (1000) yards north of Hunda Point at e range of eighty-four hundred
                    (8400) yerds. Fixed appreximately forty (40) rounds on this
                    position before flashes stopped, at which time shifted target to
                    what was believed to be a small boat. However, after tracking
                    it was determined to be a small island, probably TATAPURAKA, and
                    ceased firing.</p>
                    <p>2.  At 0315 Love sighted flares from an ooper plane on
                    port quarter, range about five thousand (5000) yerds. At 0325
                    Love commenced firing, tracking pluze aoroas formation to starboard 
                    until contact was lost on the starboard beara on the FOX
                    DOG Radar at a Farge of about four thousand (4000) yarda. It
                    is probable that this plane was shot down as the ship's Supply
                    officer, ohief commissary steward, trainer of Gun #5 looking
                    through his al Light, the gun captain of 40mm #2, the gun captain

                    and than a very large puff of white smoke just before cesse
                    firing was given. Then the plane disappoared.</p>
                    <p>3.  Three (3) other flaree were seen and three (3)
                    other separate air targets were picked up by the FOX DOG Redar
                    and taken under fire at the following times, 0321, 0330 and 0341
                    Love. Although no hits were observed, the planes were kept out

                    <p>1.  In accordance with Commander Task Group THIRTY
                    ONE POINT ONE operation order No. A16-43, the SAUFLEY proceeded
                    with Task Unit THORTY ONIS POINT ONE POINT Two from Kulcum,
                    Guadaleanal to the Treasury Islands to participate in the initial 
                    landing operations there at dawn, October 27, 1943. About
                    0745 the SAUFLEY in compney with the USS WALLER(Comander Task
                    Unit THIRTY ONE POINT ONE POINT TWO, Captain HURFF), USS PRINGLE,
                    USS COMPLICT, USS DARING, USS ADROIT, LCI220, LCI330, LCI334,
                    LOI336, LCI24, LCI61, LG167 and LCI69, commenced return to Kukum.</p>
                    <p>2.  At 1723, as directed by Commander Task Unit
                    THIRTY ONE POINT ONE POINT Two's visual dispatch 270625. the
                    SAUFLEY reversed course and left the formation to join and escort
                    the USS CONY which had been damaged in an air attack, to Purvis
                    Bay, Florida Island. At 1915, prior to joining the CONY, orders
                    were received via T.B.S. from Commander Task Unit THIRTY ONE
                    POINT ONE POINT TWO to continue in the direction of Treasury
                    Islands, join the USS PHILIP, and escort LST485, LST999 and APG37
                    to Kukum, Guadaleanal. This convey was joined at 2150. All ships
                    steamed at 10 knot 8.</p>
                    <p>3.  A bogey was picked up at 2214, bearing 290 degrees
                    true, distance nineteen miles, closing slowly on various courses.
                    B y 2240 it became apparent from the plot of the bogey that he
                    had probably detected the convoy, despite poor visibility due to
                    seattered cloud coverage of approximately thirty percent, with no
                    moon.</p>
                    <p>4.  From about 2240 to 2245 the bogey orbited close
                    estorn of the formation and then made one dummy run up the wake
                    of the formation. At 2245 the bogey made his second run over the
                    formation from astern and dropped two 200 - 500 1b bombs off the
                    quarter of LST399, the second ship in column, with slight effect.
                    The bogey then retired to the northweat. At the time of the
                    attack, the convoy was 45 miles, bearing 307 from Simbo Island
                    of the New Georgia Group.</p>
                    <p>5.  One unusual feature of this attack was the fact
                    that not only was the bogey undetected audibly, but the flames
                    from his exhaust, usually vial ble on the planes previously used
                    were not seen at any time, indicating that Japs may be using
                    exhuast shields on their night ancopers and bombers. The attack
                    was made from an altitude of approximately 3400 feet. The bogey
                    was apparently a small float plane, as indicated by his amall
                    radar pip and low speed, 120 knots. There was a period of ten
                    minutes or more when he was too close to be picked up by the 80-1
                    rader with its minimum range of about 2000 yards, and turned too
                    sharply for the FD radar to follow. During this tise he operated
                    freely immediately over the formation and was enabled to locate
                    all targets and chose one in & very deliberate meanor and with
                    almost perfect immunity from attack. No ships of the formation
                    fired at the plane due to the general instruction contained in
                    the operation order not to fire at snoopers.</p>
                    <p>6.  It is believed that this doctrine should be
                    amplified, due to the difficulty of determining just when a
                    snoopers cesses to be a snooper and becomes a bomber. During
                    recent operations this ship has had bombs dropped close aboard,
                    or torpedoes fired, on five separate occasions et night when
                    they came within one hundred yards or less from the ship.
                    on none of these occasions was there any clear cut distinction
                    between snoopers and the bombers. It is therefore believed that
                    after Initial discovery of the surface unit, as shown by dropping
                    flost Lights or perachute flares close aboard OF by the bagies
                    repeated eireling or returning to the surface unit, any plane
                    approaching within 4000 - 6000 yards should be fired on by 5"
                    using flashless powder if e good truck can be obtained by the
                    director. It is also believed that 20mm and 40nm machine guna
                    without radar control should be fired only when the plane itself
                    is clearly visible and within 500 yards of the ship and after
                    initial discovery of the surface unit.</p>
                    <p>7.  One other bogay was picked w at 0212 bearing
                    000 true, distance 14 miles. After closing to ten miles the
                    bogay retired to the northweat and the CORVOY proceeded to
                    Kukum. Guadalcanal without further incident.</p>

                    <p>1.  This ship was proceeding se escort of Task Unit
                        32.4.19 composed of U.S.S. SAUFLEY,  U.S.S. MONTGOMERY, S.S. JAMES
                        H. MCCLINTOCK, and S.S. EDWIN T MEREDITH.  The MONTGOMERY'S sound
                        gear was disabled as e result of previous collision. The SAUFLEY
                        was patrolling at 14 knots and about 4000 yards ahead of the leading 
                        freighter. Convoy speed 11 knots, zigzagging. At about 1058
                        Love, September 15, 1943, a torpedo was reported by the S.S. MCCLINTOCK
                        to have passed close aboard.  Search of the area was instituted
                        by the SAUFLEY and a clear sharp oil slick located which
                        was believed to be the torpedo wake. After about two hours of
                        search at speed of 15 knots, a definite echo was heard at 1251
                        bearing 260 (T), distance 3000 yards. This echo became sharper
                        as range decreased and was identified as as submarine contact at
                        2500 yards. As the approach developed it became evident that it
                        was a stern chase since the relative speed was 10 knots, with
                        pronounced "down doppler" and there was no change in target bearings 
                        which were narrow. For these reasons no lead angle was
                        applied and at 1257 a nine charge deep pattern was dropped, firing 
                        ten seconds "late" on the recorder. Contact was lost at 200
                        yards and it was estimated that the target was at a depth of
                        about 200 feet. No visible results were obtained from this attack.</p>
                    <p>2.  Search wes resumed and at about 1342 contact was
                        re-established bearing 270° (T), range 1500 yards, on the port
                        quarter of the SAUFLEY. At this time a large boll in the water
                        was sighted on the bearing, distance about 1300 yards. The
                        SAUFLEY reversed course to the right to take the approach and the
                        submarine also circled to the right so that by the time sub was
                        brought to SAUFLEY's bow the aub presented her stern, and then
                        apparently continued to turn, to give a target angle of about 140.
                        As the range closed to about 200 yerda and contact was lost, it
                        was apparent that the submarine was well to port. The starboard
                        K guns were not fired on this attack. Six depth charges were
                        dropped on this atteck (second) et 1349. Since the submarine was
                        still in the same position when contact was regained for the third
                        attack and showed little motion while being tracked on that attack,
                        It is evident that the second attack probably seriously injured it.</p>
                    <p>3.  At about 1353 contact was made bearing about 340
                        (T), distance 1350 yerds. The submarine's position as plotted on
                        the DRT showed no change during the approach for this attack. At
                        about 1356 a full nine charge shallow pattern (third attack) was
                        dropped.</p>
                    <p>4.  At 1412 contact was regained bearing 295° (T),
                        distance 2000 yards. During this approach the submarine showed a
                        very low speed through the water. At 1416 a five charge medium
                        pattern was dropped (fourth attack). At 1419 a disturbance or boil
                        was noted in the water in the vicinity of the spot the charges were
                        dropped. This was separate and distinct from those caused by the
                        five charges. At about 1435 contact was regained bearing about 300°,
                        (T), distance about 1500 yards. A dry run was made over him using
                        the fathometer to obtain the depth and a sounding of 33 fathoms was
                        obtained. An air "boil" was noted in this position while passing
                        over the sub.</p>
                    <p>5.  At 1443 while the SAUFLEY was turning left to return 
                        for another attack the submarine surfaced. She had no way on
                        and was on even trim. A small list was reported however, by the
                        director rangefinder operator. The conning tower came up slowly but
                        the submerine deek remained awash. When first sighted the conning
                        tower was on SAUFLEY'S port beam. The SAUFLEY was steedied with the
                        submarine bearing about 320 relative so that all guns would bear.
                        Fire was begun by all batteries, the five inch firing the first selvo
                        within about 30 seconds. Opening range was 1900 yards, rapid independent 
                        fire was used. The first few five inch shots were on in deflection 
                        and apparently short about fifty yerds. Remaining shots
                        appeared to hit on the base of the conning tower. After four or five
                        shots the conning tower was hidden in the splashes. All five inch
                        guns fired and they got off a total of 40 rounds before fire Was
                        ceased, the conning tower having completely disappeared. A hole from
                        one hit was observed in the upper part of the conning tower before 1t
                        was completely hidden in the splashes.</p>
                    <p>6.  While the five ineh guns were firing, one of the
                        two Catalina patrol planes present made a bombing run from aft of the
                        submarine at about 100 feet altitude, barely clearing the five inch
                        splashes. One of his depth oharges appeared to land right on the
                        conning tower's position and one about forty feet away, on submarine's
                        bow.  When the splash from the plane depth charges subsided the conning 
                        tower was no longer visible and gunfire was ceased. The conning
                        tower was out of the water something between one and two minutes.</p>
                    <p>7.  The SAUFLEY continued the approach, swinging to the
                        left after ceasing fire and passed over the submarine's last position.
                        About two minutes after fire was ceased an underwater explosion was
                        heard by the sound gear. At the submarine's last position many wood
                        fragments from the gun hits on the deeks and parts of gratings were
                        seen, several being from six to ten feet long. Large amounts of fresh
                        oil were also seen on the surface, the oil having a very light color
                        and a pronounced strong odor somewhat similiar to our diesel oil.</p>
                    <p>8.  At 1456 a weak contact WES established bearing 230°
                        (T), distance 2400 yards. As the approach developed it became evident 
                        from relative speed, bearings and ranges that the submarine was
                        dead in the water. At about 1501 a five charge shallow pattern was
                        dropped directly over the estimated position of the submarine, contact 
                        having been lost at 100 yards. At 1506 a large area of air
                        bubbles was sighted near spot where charges were dropped. At 1514
                        wood and oil were again observed near the spot of the last two attacks 
                        as the SAUFLEY searched the area.</p>
                    <p>9.  No further contacts were made although the SAUFLEY
                        circled the area and fully covered all possible submarine positions.
                        At 1735 as the SAUFLEY passed near the position of the last attacks,
                        in an area covering about one mile, diesel oil was seen lying on
                        the surface in patches and large globules were seen rising to the
                        surface. The odor of diesel oil was very pronounced. During the
                        afternoon and night the area was searched for fifteen hours after the
                        last attack. The PBY Patrol Plane on station during the night, made
                        no contacts.</p>
                    <p>10.  At 0600 September 16, 1943, search was stopped and
                        SAUFLEY proceeded through position of last attacks. For a distance
                        of four or five miles downwind from the spot the sea was streaked
                        with fresh light colored oil which appeared to be still rising. The
                        odor of diesel oil was very strong.</p>
                    <p>11.  Sound conditions were excellent although the effect
                        of our own wake and depth charge disturbances were very persistent.
                        This is believed probably due to the high gain permitted by the new
                        T.V.G. (reverberation suppressor). The submarine took advantage of
                        this by apparently making tight turns at high speed in the early
                        attacks and, also by remaining in the immediate vicinity of the depth
                        charge disturbance. It is believed the long time between the first
                        attack and the next sound contact was caused by returning to the area
                        of attack too soon.</p>
                    <p>12.  on the first two attacks the submarine manuevered to
                        give a stern chase during the early stages of the approach. On the
                        second attack as the range was closed to approximately six hundred
                        yards, the submarine apparently turned in tight circles at a good speed.
                        some time was lost after the first attack by searching more distant areas
                        on the assumption that the submarine would attempt a high speed get-a-way
                        after the atteck.</p>

                    <h5>3. General Remarks</h5>
                    <p>This attack was a definite stern chase as indicated by relative
                        speed. This was further brought out by Doppler Effect which showed in
                        echo of a very high pitch. The target may have turned slightly to the
                        right as we passed over him. No lead angle was taken in this attack
                        since the bearings, relative speed and doppler effect all indicated a
                        stern chase.</p>

                        from Kukum, Guadal canal, to Empresa Augusta Bay, Bougainville, 
                        as the fifth echelon on 16 November 1943. The primary
                        fighter director unit was aboard the USS PRINCLE, the secondary
                        unit being embarked in the USS SAUFLEY. The convoy was overtaken
                        and joined shortly before dawn by Transport Division TWELVE,
                        consisting of the USS STRINGHAM, USS MCKEAN, USS TALBOT, USS WATERS,
                        and Transport Division TWENTY TWO, consisting of the USS KILTY,
                        USS CROSEY, USS WARD, and the USS SCHLEY.</p>
                    <p>2.  The first bogey of the evening was reported at
                        1630, when the convoy was four miles south of Treasury Island.
                        Several additional bogies were reported to the north at a minimum
                        of 31 miles prior to sunset. Between sunset and moonrise, about
                        2145, the visibility was very poor, approximately 2000 - 3000
                        yards. During this period no bogies were reported or detected.</p>
                    <p>3.  From moonrise until 0250 on 17 November, during
                        the approach to the beaches in Empress Augusta Bay, bogies were
                        detected along the southern coast of Bougainville from Empress
                        Augusta Bay to the Shortland Islands. It is assumed that these
                        bogies were searching the east coast of Bougainville for our
                        shipping.</p>
                    <p>4.  At 2250, in accordance with written instructions
                        from Commander Destroyer Squadron TWENTY TWO, the SAUFLEY pulled
                        ahead of the formation to a distance of seven miles, for the purpose 
                        of obtaining an accurate navigational position at the earliest
                        possible opportunity to provide a clear approach for the rest of
                        the convoy.</p>
                    <p>5.  About 0250, the seventeenth, anti-aircraft bursts
                        were noted ahead over the ground positions at Cape Torokina, and
                        about 0300 a bogey was detected closing the formation from the
                        South. From this time until sunrise, the convoy was under constant 
                        observation by enemy snoopers, and subject to intermittent
                        attacks by low flying torpedo planes. The first attack was made
                        about 0320 when the USS PRINGLE reported via T.B.S. that a torpedo
                        plane making a run on the formation had crashed in the water off
                        her port bow. At this time the SAUFLEY was about seven miles, bearing 
                        220° true from Puruata Island and about eight miles ahead of
                        the formation. Despite a cloud coverage of from fifty to sixty
                        percent, visibility was good, due to the presence of a nearly full
                        moon.</p>
                    <p>6.  The MCKEAN was reported by the TALBOT to have been
                        torpedoed at 0348 during what was evidently the second attack
                        coming in over the rear of the formation.</p>
                    <p>7.  Enemy planes remained in the vicinity and about
                        0430 two planes approached the SAUFLEY from the northwest at an
                        altitude of three thousand feet, speed 150 knots. When the range
                        had closed to 2500 yards they were taken under fire with the
                        SAUFLEY'S 5" battery, whereupon they immediately turned away
                        and retired to the northwest. Fire was ceased, having expended
                        64 rounds of 5"/38 AA common. The planes were seen to be twin
                        engines bombers,believed to be Mitsubishi 97s. They were flying
                        in a tight formation and the gunnery officer believes that in
                        spite of their direct approach they were unaware of the SAUFLEY'S
                        presence. on the approach of these bogies the SAUFLEY turned
                        towards them to present as small a torpedo target as possible.</p>
                    <p>8.
                        About 0530, the LSTS and the APDs, with the exception 
                        of the USS TALBOT, who with the USS SIGOURNEY was engaged in
                        rescuing survivors from the MCKEAN, were approaching the beach.
                        The SAUFLEY was then directed by Commander Destroyer Squadron
                        TWENTY TWO to proceed with the WALLER to assist the TALBOT and the
                        SIGOURNEY with their rescue work. After screening these ships
                        when the rescue operations had been completed, the WALLER and
                        SAUFLEY proceeded to the vicinity of point Uncle, to patrol there
                        until such time as the APDs and LSTs should stand out.</p>
                    <p>9.  At 0731, while in the area of point Uncle, a large
                        group of bogies was detected bearing 315° true, distance 58 miles,
                        closing. This raid was tracked in to the vicinity of Cape
                        Torokina. No attack was made on the ships in the immediate
                        vicinity. Report of six enemy planes being shot down by our
                        fighter cover was heard over the fighter director circuit.</p>
                    <p>10.  The SAUFLEY joined up with the convoy standing out
                        from the landing beaches about 1930. Numerous bogies were reported
                        during the night, but no attacks were made on the convoy during the
                        return trip.</p>
                    <p>11.  Because of the marked differenced in the performances
                        of the various types of search radars, it is recommended that
                        Fighter Director units be assigned to ships with SC II radars.
                        The reason for this recommendation is based on the fact that the
                        SC II radar is the only one having directional IFF, which permits
                        quicker discrimination between friendly and enemy units. The two
                        other types of search radars installed in this squadron, are the
                        SC I and the SA. The performance of the SC I is much superior to
                        that of the SA.</p>
                    <p>The following air search radars are installed in ships of
                        Destroyer Squadron TWENTY TWO:</p>

                    <p>1.  The action report of the U.S.S. SAUFLEY for the subject
                        period is forwarded herewith in accordance with references (a) and (b).</p>
                    <p class="text-center">U.S.S. SAUFLEY ACTION REPORT, 8 MARCH TO 0800, 16 MARCH 1945</p>

                    <div><u>PART I</u></div>

                    <p>A.  The period covered by this report includes the
                        sortie from Mangarin Bay, Mindoro to the objective area and the
                        landing of the 41st Infantry Division on the Southorn tip of
                        Zamboanga Peninsula.</p>
                    <p>B.  The USS SAUFLEY joined Task Unit SEVENTY EIGHT

                        the afternoon proceding. The USS SAUFLEY'S participation in this
                        operation included screening of the attack group and transport unit
                        enroute to and at the objectivo aroa in addition to standing by to
                        provido firo support if called for.</p>
                    
                    <div><u>PART II</u></div>

                    <p>A.  The SAUFLEY was a unit of Task Unit SEVENTY EIGHT
                        POINT ONE POINT INO, the screen, which was under the command of
                        Commander Destroyer Squadron Twenty TWO in tho USS WALLER and
                        consisted or the USS WALLER, USS BANCROFT, USS ROBINSON, USS PHILIP,
                        USS SIGOURNEY, USS STUFLEY, USS Billey, USS CHAFFEE, USS RUDDERO
                        USS PC 1134, USS PC 1133, USS SC 698 and USS SC 741. Destroyers of
                        the screen provided such fire support at night as was necessary and
                        requested.</p>
                    <p>B.  Own forces consisted of the Cruiser Covering Group,
                        the Notor Torpedo Boat Unit, the Transport Units, the Screen, the
                        Support Craft Unit, the Landing Craft Control and Beachmaster Unit,
                        the Service Unit and the linesweeping Unit. Those operated in and
                        around the objectivo aroa in accordance with the operation plan.</p>
                    <p>C.  No enony forces were cocountered although duo to the
                        number of small craft operating in the area at night suspicion as
                        to identity of radar targets occasionally arose. Small abandoned
                        native craft were in a similar category.</p>

                    <p>B.  On all firo su ort stations the ship was in
                        Condition of Roadiness I-E. Condition I was set each morning
                        prior to sunrise and during actual firing. Material Condition
                        A modified for ventilation was maintained at all times.</p>
                    <p>C.  The weather favored the operation and at no time
                        was visibility impaired duo to this source, The dark evenings
                        made navigation on Fire Support Station in channel North of Santa
                        Cruz Islands rathor difficult.</p>
                
                    <div><u>PART IV</u></div>

                    <p>A.  The operation order made no montion of the 500 rounds
                        of 5"/38 calibor MK 32 ammunition carriod by dostroyers. Lacking
                        other orders, and as directed by the Commander Dostroyer Squadron
                        TWENTY TWO, the comunition loading order was interpreted to mean
                        rotontion of Mk 32 ammunition, and loading of other components in
                        oxcess of allowance.</p>
                
                    <div><u>PART V</u></div>

                    <p>This ship sustained no battle damage. No enemy
                        units were encountered.</p>

                    <div><u>PART VI</u></div>

                    <p>A.  IFF performance was normal and radar performance
                        in general was good. Fighter direction was not conducted from this
                        ship.</p>

                    <p>B.  Between 1850 and 1915 on 13 March, when an enemy
                        plano was reported to be in the area, this ship picked up occasional
                        and short signals on the R.C.M. goar. The characteristic of the
                        signals cons stod of a 3 to 5 microsecond pulse length on a
                        froquency of 155 megacycles. It is believed that the signal
                        emanated from Japaneso airborno radar.</p>

                    <p>C.  Navigation in these areas was difficult due to the
                        volocity of the curront although useful information on this was
                        contained in the operation order, Rad I fixes in many cases were
                        not good and the small craft traffic as stated before was an additional 
                        hazard.</p>

                    <div><u>PART VII</u></div>

                    <p>A.  Personnol of this ship suffered no casualties and
                        performed their duties in a capable and efficient manner.</p>

                    <div><u>PART VIII</u></div>

                    <p>1.  The following comments, suggostions and recommendation
                        are submitted based on difficulties encountered in this operation,
                        and from the experience gained in present and previous assaults.</p>

                    <p>A.  All shipping which can be spared retire at night to
                        simplify target identification and defense by night fire support
                        ships.</p>

                    <p>B.  Ships remaining in the objective area have definite
                        assigned stations to maintain. Ships remining at the objectivo
                        area, especially large ships, such as destroyers, be informed of
                        all movements in the area, of all ships remaining and their assigned
                        stations.</p>

                    <p>C.
                        11 ships remaining at the objective area at night
                        report to the Senior Officer Present (for that night) and remain
                        under his operational control. Any unscheduled movements, or movements 
                        into or out of the area be cloared first through the Senior
                        Officer Present to prevont possible confusion with eneny small
                        craft. It will bc holpful if PT Captains report on board the
                        destroyer Senior Officer Present to discuss their nutual movements.</p>

                    <p>D.  Plans for night retirement be included in the
                        operation order, or promulgated to all ships as early us possible.
                        Timos of retirement of several groups can be scheduled so that
                        traffic difficultics in leaving the i modiate objectivo are minimized. 
                        Similarly, and much oasier to accomplish, returning groups
                        be scheduled to arrivo in succession to minimize mutu 1 interlocking
                        of sereons, especially in the dark before dawn.</p>

                    <p>E.  Small craft be assigned to intercept and interrogate
                        small nativo'craft which invariably approach an assault with "useful
                        information". It is not considered advisable, when smaller units are
                        available, for relativoly largo, slow, destroyers to approach and
                        examino nativo craft, anyone of which could possibly conceal a
                        booby trap or Bangor Torpodo. PT boats aro recommended for such
                        work; they have the floxibility to approoch and closely examine
                        nativo small craft, and the power to got cloar quickly if occasion
                        domands. They are further moro adaptable to closing the Officer in
                        Tactical Command to deliver nativos with useful information.</p>

                    <p>F.  Small craft, LCI's, etc., be instructed to keep clear
                        of destroyers and largor ships. During night fire support duty in
                        the narrow channel North of Santa Cruz Islands SAUFLEY had three
                        LCI's drift down, one ahoad 50 yards, and one on either bow: SAUFLEY
                        cloared the area by backing out of the assigned support area.
                        another tino S. UFILY spent 15 minutos trying to got through an
                        LCI screen across the channel North of Santa Cruz Islands; this
                        was finally accomplished by gotting as close as possible to the
                        petrol and thon going chond flank. This is not considered good
                        sconanship or safo at night in very restricted waters with a 6 knot
                        current.</p>

                    <p>G.  when possible, destroyers be stationed for night
                        support in wators with adequate naneuvoring room for case of navigation 
                        and action against enemy small boats. In the present case,
                        it is bolioved that sufficiently accurate harassing firo could have
                        boon delivored from the channel South of Santa Cruz Islands. Further
                        destroyer night firo support missions usu lly are limited to starshell 
                        illunination. 5"/38 calibor starshells operate satisfactorily
                        only at rangos greator than 6000 y rds. For these reasons it is
                        bolioved that the primary destroyer night firo support station would
                        better have boon in the Basilan Straits South of Santa Cruz Islands.</p>

                    <p>2.  While it is not usual to include such remarks in an
                        action report, the Commanding Officer feels that the spirit of
                        working togother, with mutual support, was outstanding in this
                        operation. Particularly notoworthy is the assistance rendered by
                        both Staff and Ship's Company on the ROCKY MOUNT in installing
                        and servicing now radio equipment.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">DESCRIPTION OF ACTION #1</p>
                    <p>One Japanese plane (believed to be a Val with retractable
                        landing gear) came over the formation from ahead, starboard bow,
                        and was taken under fire by 5" batteries of cruisers and destroyers 
                        who were forced to cease fire in order not to hit other
                        ships. Two starboard 40MM directors commenced tracking when the
                        plane bore 010°R at a range of about 5000 yards, and commenced
                        firing when the plane bore 035°R at a range of about 4000 yards.
                        Although hits were observed the plane appeared to be under control
                        when it went into a small white cloud during which time it was
                        kept under fire. As the plane came out of the cloud it turned
                        toward the ship to commence a dive attack. Hits were still observed 
                        and shortly plane lost control and crashed into the sea
                        at about 3000 yards bearing 070°R. Officers of this command
                        observed that this ship was the only one firing on the plane when
                        it lost control and crashed.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-center">DESCRIPTION OF ACTION #2</p>
                    <p>While the 40MM were firing on the port side, the main
                        battery director picked up a Zero on the starboard side from
                        lookouts reports. This plane approached from the port bow
                        then changed course to pass astern. This ship commenced firing
                        at 1156 at 250°R in optical control range of 5000 yards with
                        a solution of speed 200 knots, target angle 270°, altitude
                        3500 feet. The MARYLAND, directly astern, was also firing
                        at this plane. This ship was firing 60% special fuzes and
                        bursts were observed all around the target. This ship ceased
                        fire when the plane was hit and crashed into the sea at 200°R,
                        range 7000 yards.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">DESCRIPTION OF ACTION #3</p>
                    <p>The third plane, a Jill was picked up by the SG radar
                        at 20,000 yds and control commenced tracking immediately
                        being already on the bearing having tracked a Tony out to boat that
                        area. that area. This plane was coming directly in 50' above the
                        Shortly thereafter the Jill was reported by a PT
                        in surface of the water at 180 knots. The Minneapolis, directly at
                        ahead, and the Maryland, directly astern, commenced firing
                        about 12,000 yds. At 1220 with the range 7,000 yds this ship
                        angle 0° gpeed 180 knots and continued firing until at plane about
                        commenegd firing in optical control with a solution of the target
                        made a 50 turn to the left and crashed into the water
                        fuses and all burst were observed. No observers saw ahead torpedo
                        3800 yds bearing 235 Rel. This ship was firing 60% special a
                        launched although the Maryland reported a wake passed
                        a few minutes later.</p>
                    <p>Observers on this ship counted fifteen enemy planes during
                        the attack and observed nine crash in or near the formation.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">U.S.S. SAUFLEY DESCRIPTION OF ACTION OF 29 NOVEMBER 1944.</p>

                    <p>During the morning and afternoon of November
                        29th, 1944, the USS SAUFLEY under orders issued by the Screen
                        Commander of Task Group SEVENTY SEVEN POINT TWO had been
                        patrolling the northern sector of the Baker - Charlie patrol.
                        The patrol line was established to seaward through a point
                        one mile bearing 120° true from point REB. Point REB lay
                        midway between the southern tip of Homonhon Island and the
                        northern tip of Dinagat Island on the eastern side of Leyte
                        Gulf, P.I. The line was patrolled in a figure eight making
                        all turns to seaward at a speed of eighteen knots. The ship
                        was in Condition of Readiness I-E and Material Condition Able
                        with two boilers on the main steam line and steam in reserve
                        for twenty eight knots. Numerous reports of a threatening
                        air attack had been received through-out the day. An anti-
                        submarine search as well as an anti-aircraft long and short
                        scale search were being conducted. The USS AULICK WILS patrolling 
                        the southern sector of the same patrol line and Task
                        Group SEVENTY SEVEN POINT TWO was steeming in Leyte Gulf.
                        Visibility was hampered by low strato cumulus clouds which
                        opened showing alto cumulus and high cirrus moving from 250°
                        true. Intermittent rain and a four knot wind from 250 true
                        were accompanied by a calm sea with low swells from the southwest. 
                        Enemy forces encountered were two Japanese Vals and
                        one Japanese Zero. No enemy surface forces were sighted.</p>
                    <p>At 1702(I) on November twenty ninth the
                        SAUFLEY set Condition of Readiness I-E, after a "Flash White"
                        had been put out on the Air Warning Circuit. The ship had
                        been at General Quarters during a "Flash Red" in Leyte Gulf.
                        The ship was headed on true course 217° true approaching the
                        southern end of the assigned patrol. The air search radar
                        screen was clear of all but friendly planes and was for the
                        most part land-locked.</p>
                    <p>At 1752(I) it was reported that the AULICK
                        was firing her AA battery, and subsequently the Commanding
                        officer observed a plane approaching from the west through
                        a break in the low hanging clouds. This plane, identified
                        as Japanese, crossed to eastward as the ship turned with full
                        right rudder and rapidly accelerated to flank speed. Battle
                        stations were manned; rudder was put amidships. The plane
                        circled left and commenced its run from the port bow apparently
                        heading for the bridge. During this approach the ship was
                        turned hard left in an effort to force the plane to cross
                        ahead. This deception, in addition to the fact that the plane
                        had been hit by the ships gunfire, resulted in the plane with
                        bomb load intact crashing in flames close aboard to starboard
                        at 1755(I). As this plane, identified as a Japanese Val,
                        struck the water its bomb load exploded and the vibration
                        of the crash and bomb concussion caused considerable damage
                        to be inflicted to the ships structure, starboard side
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>Both engines were stopped to prevent further
                        damage to the hull in case of flooding. When the wreckage had
                        drifted clear it wes believed that the hull plating had not
                        been too seriously damaged, and as a Japanese Zero was seen to
                        commence a strafing run from the port quarter, flank speed and
                        full right rudder were ordered. Good headway had been attained
                        prior to 1756 (I) at which time the Zero, having been hit by the
                        full force of the port machine gun battery, made C. steep left
                        bank and crashed into the ships port side a few feet under the
                        forward boat davit. Glancing off the side it burst into flames
                        close aboard on the port bow.</p>
                    <p>About three minutes later another Val, observed
                        approaching from 190° relative, was taken under fire by the
                        after machine guns. The SAUFLEY was making flank speed and
                        turning left to ummask all port machine guns. The plane banked
                        left at the same time releasing its bombs, which flew between
                        the stacks exploding on contact with the water close aboard to
                        starboard. The resulting explosion covered the starboard
                        weather deeks with green water causing damage to personnel in
                        that vicinity. The Val is believed to have been hit by ships
                        gun fire, as following its left bank it leveled out, flew over
                        the ship and caught fire as it crashed about fifty yards on the
                        starboard bow.</p>
                    <p>The SAUFLEY'S attack was reported to the Commander
                        Task Group SEVENTY SEVEN POINT TWO following the attack by the
                        first Val. At approximately 1810 (I) it was reported that Task
                        Group SEVENTY SEVEN POINT TWO was under heavy air attack. Subsequent 
                        to the attack by the third plane a burst of flame was
                        observed coming from the forward superstructure of the AULICK.
                        At 1830 the condition watch was set, speed reduced to 18.0
                        knots as the AULICK fell in astern having suffered considerable
                        damage. The two ships steamed the patrol line under cover of a
                        heavy rain cloud until the AULIOK was relieved on station and
                        the SAUFLEY resumed her normal patrol.</p>
                    <p>At no time could the five inch battery be brought
                        to bear on any of the three targets. The time interval was such
                        that tracking with the computer was out of the question. The fire
                        control radar and optical range finder were put out of commission
                        by the first explosion, the shock of which jarred the director to
                        the extent of damaging the roller path. Gun number one was recoiled
                        by the force of the explosion shearing off the housing bolts.
                        The machine gun battery took the burden of all three attacks
                        and performed in an excellent and most effective manner.
                        Enemy aircraft gunnery was considered weak and ineffective
                        as both bombs and machine guns missed their mark; there
                        being no evidence of strafing damage to the ship or its
                        personnel.</p>
                    <p>Battle damage upon examination revealed the

                            stripped; two holding sorewa on top of the housing were
                            loosened.</li>
                        <li>2. Hydraulic and electric system of dredger type hoist in
                            #1 magazine. All hydraulic leads and electric leads
                            were broken when the entire unit was moved 4th off its
                            base by the force of the explosion.</li>
                        <li>3. Dredger type hoist in #2 magazine was set off center
                            by the force of the explosion.</li>
                        <li>4.  The Gyro in the Stable element was stopped by the force
                            of the explosion. Electric leads were not broken.</li>
                        <li>5. Force of explosion caused excess play in elevation of
                            level linkage on 100 12 radar.</li>
                        <li>6. One 40MM barrel was damaged by debris.</li>
                        <li>7. Original 40MM open sight was damaged by debris.</li>
                        <li>8. The main battery director rollor path upon inspection
                            was revealed to have at least 4 rough spots. Shock is
                            believed to have loosened or weakened the holding
                            down bolts.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Damage to the enemy consisted of the complete
                        destruction of three planes together with their crows. The
                        Zero which crashed into the portside was strewn in small
                        pieces from the forward 40MM mount to the Midships mount.
                        Various parts of the pilots body were found on the port side
                        of the superstructure together with his parachute pack and
                        fragments of a life jacket.</p>
                    <p>Communications on every circuit were somewhat 
                        garbled by rain static although the report of the
                        SAUFLEY'S attack was receipted for by Commander Task Group
                        SEVENTY SEVEN POINT TWO whose report of being under air
                        attack was distinetly heard.</p>
                    <p>The air search radar as previously stated
                        was almost entirely land looked, partially due to its
                        abnormally large side lobe. All reders were put out of
                        commission by the shook of the first explosion. Operation
                        on all three was resumed within ten minutes after the third
                        attack. Ship handling played & large part in the deception of
                        all three planes. Well timed hard turns and changes in speed
                        contributed in large measure towards upsetting the plan of
                        attack and timing of each pilot. Persistent machine gun
                        crows and a beffling change of pace on the pert of the conn
                        resulted in complete destruction of all three attacks.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion it might be stated that little
                        if any warning was given of these attacks. Radar detection
                        of enemy planes in this area was restricted by large bodies
                        of land to the North and South. It was known, however, that
                        enemy planes were in the area and the weather was definitely
                        in their favor. The question arises as to whether or not
                        the Japanese "Suieide Squadron" was involved in this encounter. 
                        If such was the case the attempts of creah diving
                        the ship were complete failures. Two plenes crashed in the
                        water seemingly out of control either because they were
                        forced to alter their tactics due to the ships meneuvers
                        or because they had already been rendered inoperative by
                        gunfire. The Zero which crashed into the portside was obviously
                        making en attempt to veer away from the ship in 8. tight left
                        turn.</p>
                    <p>Personnel casualties were light considering
                        the weight and strength of the attack. One man was blown
                        over the side by the explosion and twenty others sustained
                        minor cuts and fractures. None of these required hospitalisation.
                        For the most part the performance of personnel was of e high
                        standard both under fire and in handling subsequent damage.</p>

                <div><u>PART I</u></div>

                <p>On the morning of July 16, 1944 the USS SAUFLEY
                    was ordered by Commander Task Force FIFTY TWO to deliver destructive 
                    fire on specified targets on the island of Tinian.
                    These orders were received in the form of a secret mailgram.
                    Prior to this time the SAUFLEY had been engaged in fueling
                    ship after being detached from Task Unit FIFTY SEVEN POINT
                    EIGHTEEN POINT TWENTY with orders to report to the Commander
                    Transport Screen at Saipan Island.</p>
                <p>The instructions issued for the bombardment
                    gave specific target areas as listed in Enclosure (B) with
                    the stipulation that no target was to be fired upon without
                    benefit of air observation and spot. Air bursts were to be
                    employed for the destruction of observed personnel, and white
                    phosphorous in excess of twenty rounds remaining on board WES
                    authorized for the burning of foliage, cave and the extermination 
                    of personnel from caves.</p>
                <p>This destructive fire mission was to terminate
                    by sunset on the same date at which time the SAUFLEY should
                    remain to the Northward of the 00 grid line passing through the
                    island until darkness had set in. After dark the ship was to
                    proceed to an area Southwest of Tinian Town for the purpose of
                    delivering harassing fire throughout the night until sunrise of
                    the following morning. This fire was to be placed in areas
                    suspected of enemy activity at irregular rates and times.
                    Anticipation by the enemy of the timing and placing of all shots
                    was to be denied. Indication of plans for future landing
                    operations or attacks on Tinian Town area and the beaches surrounding 
                    the island were to be avoided.</p>
                <p>The allowed expenditure of ammunition was as
                    follows; 400 rounds for specific targets listed, 50 rounds for
                    targets of opportunity and 75 rounds for night harassing fire.
                    An additional expenditure of 120 rounds of 40MM ammunition was
                    allowed for the initial night harassing fire as it was desired
                    that an effect should be made to catch any enemy personnel
                    happening to be exposed.</p>
                <p>The usual Easterly wind with moderate velocity
                    prevailed and the ses was calm. Visibility at all times was
                    excellent. No onemy opposition was encountered.</p>

                <div><u>PART II</u></div>

                <p>At 1200 on July 16 the SAUFLEY went to General
                    Quarters and proceeded to the viainity Southwest of Tinian Town.
                    when communications with the spotting plane had been established,
                    a one gun salvo was fired into target area 534-X in which a
                    covered field place was located although unobserved by this
                    vessel. The battery was apotted on by the plane, and in spite
                    of heavy follage preventing accurate observation the area was
                    reported as well covered. At 1301 target areas 542-C and 542-D
                    were taken under fire with similar results. At 1332 the spotting
                    plane was foreed to return to base with & broken oil line.
                    Consequently air observation ceased and permission was obtained
                    from Commander Task Force FIFTY 210 to continue the mission
                    without benefit of air observation as no relief plane could be
                    provided. At 1345 the ship opened fire on a target of opportunity 
                    in area 554-P. This target was clearly visible as a
                    cave. It was well covered and fire WES subsoquently shifted
                    to caves observed in area 553-W. These were taken under fire
                    as targets of opportunity, and although no activity was
                    observed it could be readily seen that whatever may have
                    existed was effected by this fire. A new position on the
                    Northwest cosst of the island was reached at 1530 and the
                    battery commenced firing on target areas 623-T and 624-P.
                    It was presumed that three 15CM guns due in side of cliff
                    with overhead cover were located in these areas. These could
                    not be seen from the ship. Gaves and structures partially
                    obscured by follage were noticed in these areas which were
                    completely covered by twenty selvos. At 1543 another cave in
                    area 624-G was fired upon. At 1608 fire was shifted back to
                    the structure under heavy follage in area 624-P. This structure
                    WORLD completely demolished. At 1616 another cave is area 624-H
                    was taken under fire and well covered. Target areas 606-Y,
                    648-AB and 648-BG could not be observed from the ship and,
                    since air observation was not available, were by-passed. These
                    were inland and hidden by the land contour. it 1715 the SAUFLEY
                    was in position on the Eastern side of the island to fire on
                    cave in area 604-M. It was suspected that it contained personnel 
                    and stores. The area was carefully observed for signs
                    of activity, and at 1742 fire was opened and spotted into the
                    cave. The exterior and surrounding foliage which appeared to
                    ba extremely thick waa adequately covered, but without noticeable 
                    effect. It is believed, however, that buildings in the
                    area were dazaged but not destroyed, as on a leter mission the
                    same target was taken under fire with air bursts and white
                    phosphorous resulting in a large fire. At 1815 the condition
                    watch was set and the ship proceeded Northward through Saipas
                    Channel in order to arrive off Tinion Town at dark for the
                    harmesing fire mission.</p>
                <p>At 1956 battle stations were canned and at 2035
                    the first salvos were delivered. This was continued at irregular
                    intervals but constantly throughout the night until 0523 the
                    following morsing. Targets were chosen from current intelligence
                    shorts and gride and consisted of military positions, gun
                    emplacements and portions of Tinion Town where small fires
                    broire out. These fires were covered by 40124 fire for the
                    purpose of barassing personnel in she vieinity. The first fire
                    was noticed in area 529-0 at 2150. The second broke out in
                    the eres and was azain raked by 4021 burats at 0225. At
                    daybreak no activity was observed in these areas. Aa ammunition
                    report was given to Commander Task Force FIFTY TWO who in turn
                    ordered the SAUFLEY to report to the Screen Commander for duty.</p>

                <div><u>PART III</u></div>

                <p>There were no material failures. During daylight 
                    the battery was initially trained on target by obtaining
                    navigational fixes and bearings to target areas. At night full
                    radar control was used for the initial salvo in any particular
                    area. A total of 337 rounds of AA Common, one (1) round of
                    white phosphorous and 122 rounds of 40144 were expended. Of the
                    latter 32 rounds were incendiary ammunition.</p>

                <div><u>PART IV</u></div>

                <p>No battle damage was sustained by this vessel.
                    Damage to energy forces or material is unknown.</p>

                <div><u>PART V</u></div>

                <p>Communications with the spotting plane during
                    the first phase of the mission were excellent. It seems
                    unfortunete that the plane's broken oil line brought to an end
                    such reliable, cooperative and accurate observation.</p>

                <div><u>PART VI</u></div>

                <p>Personal performed their duties efficiently and
                    capably. One minor casualty resulted from the second phase of
                    this mission. The hot shellman in Gun 2 sustained a dislocated
                    shoulder from an ejected shell, and was given treatment by the
                    Medical officer in Sick Bay.</p>

                    these were obtained by officer sessenger in the form or a
                    secret mailgras. white Phosphorous shell fire was to be delivered 
                    into the souths of specified caves on Tician Island
                    for the purpose of burning enery yermonnel and equipment therein. 
                    Advantageous positions at the elosest precticable ranges
                    were to be taken in order to place single shots into the eaves.
                    The special air and gunnery target may (scale 1/20,000) was
                    to be employed for studying terrain surrounding assigned areas
                    in order to loeste and identify canouflaged caves. To displace
                    any samouflage direct fire impact bursts were ordered. The
                    best light conditions were to be attained by firing from Eastward 
                    of the island in the forenoon, and from the Testward in
                    the afternoon. Air spotting was not available.</p>

                    and 75 rounds of AA Conson for worth while targete observed.
                    white Phosphorous was to be opportioned in order of the observed
                    deportance of the targets. Low air bureta were ordered for
                    use against econying personnel. The mission was to end upon
                    expenditure of the ammunition allowance but not later then

                    was to report to the Sereen Commander for duty.</p>
                <p>Intelligence was provided in the form of
                    information that air strikes would be made on the Southern
                    holf of Tinian. Guafiro was to continue during these strikes
                    as long sa the reage provided. a seximum ordinate not in ozesse
                    of 1000 feet. Information regarding any such excess was to

                <p>Visibility was excellent with seattered alto-
                    cumulus clouds. Light to moderate Estarly winds prevailed
                    accompanied by a moderately choppy ses. No enery forces were
                    encountered.</p>

                <div><u>PART II</u></div>

                <p>At 1120 the ship was in position heading 180 (T),
                    approximately 1.5 miles to the Eastward of the Northern point
                    of Tinian Island with listle or no headway on. Battle stations
                    were manned and a thorough study was sade of the assigned
                    target areas, 636-Y and 635-Y. AS 1125 one anot was fired at
                    the cave in area 636-Y. This burst on top or the ridge above
                    the area. Subsequent bursta were placed in earl around the
                    mouth of the Gave. A considerable volume of anoko was observed
                    in the eave after firing had been shifted to target area 635-Y
                    at 1200. This new target was heavily covered with follage
                    which, it is believed was too green to burn after ten (10)
                    White Phosphorous bursts had been placed in the area of the
                    cave. At 1223 after taking station to the Eastward of Yellow
                    beach fire was opened on ezes 604-M in which a cavo and the
                    roofs of several buildings were observed. The first shot
                    started a large fire, and after subsequent bursts had been
                    repeatedly placed is the same locality the zooftops were no
                    longer visible. Bursta were placed in the cave above the
                    buildings to-gether with sen AA Common air burste for the
                    purpose of destroying possible personnel. At 1305 target area
                    615-9RVW was taken under fire. This area was a sandy strip
                    of beson flanked by grass covered rooks. objects appearing
                    to be drums and eases were strewn is front of what appeared
                    to be small caves. Trenches were noticed as well 60 a machine
                    gun nest on a smell grams-covered promontory. The area was
                    well covered, and the machine gun nest was completely destroyed. 
                    Low air bureta were fired into the smell 00708 with
                    accuracy. At 1407 fire was delivered into what appeared to
                    be a cave in area 512-I. This was covered with five (5)
                    white Phosphorous salvos. AD 1508 white Phosphorous solvos
                    were fired into a cave in the side of a cliff in area 514-0
                    on the Southern end of Tinian. A building in this area was

                    were well covered with the exception of one in area 633-Y and
                    that & large fire was started in buildings below the cave in
                    area 604-M Targets in other areas were not located but white
                    Phosphorous was fixed into the arees. It was stated that a
                    spotting plane would have been of great assistance on camouflaged 
                    caves. An assumition report followed.</p>
                <p>The SAUFLEY then reported to the Screen

                    <div><u>PART I</u></div>

                    <p>On the afternoon of July 27, 1944 the USS SAUFLEY
                        was standing by awaiting orders in the Transport area, Snipan
                        Island. At 1523 on that date orders were received for the SAUFLEY
                        to be in Fire Support Sector Three off Tinian Island at 1900
                        for a fire support mission. At 1849 the ship joined the USS
                        PATTERSON in sector Three and went to General Quarters. Instructions 
                        to both the SAMPLEY and the PATTERSON had been received
                        as follows in plain language:</p>
                    <p>FIRE MISSION TONIGHT SUNSET TO DAWN X ACTION ADEES ALTERNATE
                        IN DELIVERY HARASSING FIRES FROM RANGE BAND BAKER IN SECTOR
                        THREE ON FOLLOWING TARGETS 548-R, 560-L, 549-U, 536-H, 534-I X

                    <p>It was decided that the SAUFLEY would take station
                        in column 1000 yards satern of the PATTERSON and that the two
                        ships would make firing runa every two hours throughout the night
                        until 0430. The non-firing ship would become counter battery
                        fire ship when the other commenced firing. Shore based or airborne 
                        observation was not available.</p>
                    <p>The sea was celm and was accompanied by gentle
                        Masterly breezes as this sector was to leeward of the island.</p>
                    
                    <div><u>PART II</u></div>

                    <p>On the first run at 1936 two rounds were fired
                        into target area 548-R. Successive PUDS were made at intervels
                        until down of July 28 without incident except at 2145 when the
                        SAUFLEY was ordered to deliver counter bettery fire into target
                        area 531-U. Forty Two rounds including one white phosphorous
                        shell were expended in this area. At 0435 the last run was made
                        on target area 531-U after which an ammunition report was made
                        to Commander Task Force FIFTY TWO and the SAUFLEY reported to
                        the Transport Soreen Commander for duty.</p>

                    <div><u>PART III</u></div>

                    <p>There were no material failures. The entire
                        allowance of one hundred fifty rounds of AA Common was expended
                        on the harassing fire mission in addition to forty two rounds
                        which were expended for counter bettery fire. The effectiveness
                        of the ship's gunfire is unknown.</p>

                    <div><u>PART IV</u></div>

                    <p>No battle damage wes sustained by this vessel.

                    <div><u>PART I</u></div>

                    <p>Prior to the assigned mission the USD SAGFLEY
                        had been fueling ship in the Transport area off Saipan Island.
                        Orders were received from Commander Task Force FIFTY TWO to
                        proceed to Fire Support Sector Five off Tinian Island, and to
                        standby for fire mission as requested by Naval Cutffire liason
                        Officers 21 and 22, together with Shore Fire Control Party 21.</p>
                    <p>The sea was calm and accompanied by the prevailing 
                        Easterly breeze. Visibility was good except during
                        intermittent rain squalls on July 31.</p>

                    <div><u>PART II</u></div>

                    <p>At 1100 on July 30, the SAUFLEY commenced
                        patrolling on various courses in Fire Support Sector Five
                        awaiting instructions from the Fire Control Parties. At 1850
                        Navel Gunfire Liason officer requested illumination in Target
                        Area 540-U at the rate of four per hour with sa elevation of
                        1500 to 2000 feet. Bettle stations were manned at 1652 and
                        after adjusting position the first starshell was fixed at 1947
                        from gun 44. At 1953 a firing rate of six stars per hour was
                        requested. This was carried out throughout the night until
                        0540 on the morning of July 31, when the SAUFLEY was ordered
                        by Shore Fire Control Party 21 to standby for a bombardment
                        mission. This was reported together with an ammunition report
                        to Commander Task Force FIFTY INO. The ship was subsequently
                        requested to lie to in grid position 025-99, and was given
                        troop front line data for the purpose of maintaining fire in
                        a safe area.</p>
                    <p>At 0655 Shore Fire Control Party 21 requested
                        two gun selvos of AA Conson with an elevation of 200 feet in
                        Target Area 524-X, Bettle stations were manned at 0658, but
                        the ship was unable to consence firing due to e foul range
                        caused by two larger ships firing in the save area. A change
                        of position to clear this range would have resulted in firing
                        from en angle such as to endanger our ORB front lines ashore.
                        At 0811 the first salvo was fired into the assigned area. The
                        smoke from a concentration of fire in approximately the same
                        area prevented all observation. At 1824 the area was covered
                        and three rapid fire full salvos were requested. At 0829 the
                        target area was shifted and at 0838 the ship commonead firing
                        into target area 524-N. One white phosphorous shell was requested 
                        on the last salvo which was fired at 0855. The SAUFLEY was
                        then instructed to standby for B new target designation. st
                        1230 Commender Task Force FIFTY TWO ordered the USS CONY to relieve 
                        the SAUFLEY on this mission. At 1320 the CONT stood into
                        the area and relieved the SAYFLEY on station. The condition
                        II watch was set and the SAUFLEY proceeded to soreening station
                        14 Able as ordered.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">USS SAUFLEY NIGHT STARSFELL ILLUMINATION OF TINIAN ISLAND, 4-5 AUGUST 1944</p>

                    <div><u>PART I</u></div>

                    <p>Prior to this mission the USS SAUFLEY had been
                        patrolling on screening station #5 until relieved by the USS
                        WADLRIGH at 1837 on August 4th. At this time orders were received 
                        from Commander Task Force FIFTY TWO for the SAUFLEY to take
                        station in Fire Support Sector #3, southwest of Tinian Town and
                        to await target assignment from Naval Gunfire Liason officer #81.</p>

                    <p>The sea WAS calm and was accompanied by variable winds.
                    Visibility veried with intermittent rain squalls throughout the night
                    and the following morning.</p>

                    <div><u>PART II</u></div>

                    <p>Battle stations were manned at 1925, after communications 
                        had been established with Neval Gunfire Linson
                        Officers #81, #82, and #83. Oboe #82 implied that he would
                        not require fire support unless a counter attack developed.
                        At 1941 a modified condition I watch was set and this ship stoodby
                        patrolling the area on various courses at reduced speeds. At
                        2040 instructions were received from Oboe #81 to commence illuminating 
                        Target Area 512-F. The first starshell was fired at 2048.
                        A firing rate of six starshells per hour was maintained until
                        2147, when Oboe 183 requested illumination. de was informed that
                        the amount of starshells on board would not permit illuminating
                        two targets at the rate of six per hour for each. At 2200 it was
                        agreed that each target would be alternately Illuminated at a
                        rate of four starshells per hour. Oboe #83 assigned Target Area
                        525-P, and illusination was commenced at 2202. Spots were applied
                        after each selvo by the observers until satisfactory illumination
                        was being provided in both areas. At 0543 Oboe 83 requested the
                        SAUFLEY to cease illumination, and reported that it had been
                        very good throughout the night. Formission to cease illuminating
                        for Oboe #81 was requested, and subsequently greated at 0545.
                        An ammunition report was then sent to Commander Task Force FIFTY
                        THO. The SAUFLEY continued patrolling in Fire Support Sector #3
                        until ordered to proceed to the Transport Area off Saipan.</p>

                    <p>1. AS 0600 Victor William, 2 June 1944, this ship
                        made aortic from Fearl Barbor, T.M., as part of Task Group
                        FIFTY ONS POINT HIGHTERN (Rear Admiral W.H.P. BLANDY, officer
                        in Tactical Commond), and set course for Kwajaleis Atoll,
                        Marshall Islands in accordance with Operation Order A258-44.
                        This group arrived at Kwajalein Atoil on 9 June 1944, sad after
                        fulfilling logistic requirements got underway on 11 June 1944,
                        and net course for Saipan, Mariance Islands.</p>
                    <p>2. On 11 June 1944, at 1915 Love while on course
                        260 (T), and in station 5.5075 of a six ship sereen this ship
                        made sound contact bearing 285 (T), distance 1,000 yards,
                        position, Letitude 08-59-30 North, Longitude 167-12-00 East.
                        (USS SAUFLEY, ASH-1, dated 11 June 1944). At 2,320 this ship
                        was relieved at the acese of contact by the USS TRANKS, and
                        proceeded to rejoin Task Group FIFTY ONE POINT SIGNTEEN.</p>
                    <p>3. The convey arrived at Caipan on 16 June 1944,
                        and at 0600 Ling, 17 June 1944, the UBS SAUFLEY, uas FALLER,
                        and uss PRINGLE complied with orders to report to Consunder
                        Task Group FIFTY TWO POINT DEVENTIE in Usa LOUISVILLE (Rear
                        Admiral J.B. OLDENDORF) for anore fire support missions.</p>
                    <p>4. The first fire support mission assigned the
                        SAUFLEY was the bosbardment of Aelito Airfield. This vessel
                        proceeded to Fife Support Sector 16, and at 0825 consenced
                        bombardment, employing alow harressing fire as directed.
                        Bombardment was conducted at a mean range of about 6,500 yards.
                        When directed by Shore Fire Control Party at 0849 cessed firing 
                        on airfield. Area was reported effectively covered.
                        One hundred-three rounds of AA Common ammunition and one
                        WP projectile were expended on this mission.</p>
                    <p>5. At 1757, on the same day while this vessel
                        was patrolling in Fire Support Sector 26, all ships were
                        called to General Quarters to repel air attacks. At 1907
                        the SAUFLEY took two Tonya underfire with nor 40ml betteries.
                        (USS SAUFLEY AA Action Report dated 17 June 1944).</p>
                    <p>6. On 16 June 1944, at 0120 commenced illumination
                        of ares 140 Able with starshells, having been directed to do
                        so by Shore Fire Control Party. Illucin tion was maintained
                        to barress the eneay throughout the night, firing storshells
                        at irregular intervals over the designated ares from a mesa
                        reage of about 7,500 yards. Total expenditure of ammunition
                        was 22 rounds of starshells.</p>
                    <p>7. AS 1757 on 18 June 1944, while patrolling in
                        Fire Support Sector 16, the SAUFLEY went to General Quarters
                        to repel air attacks. Three Japanese Tonys were taken under
                        fire at 1618 by the 5 inch and 40mm batteries(DSB BABFLET AA
                        Action Report, dated 18 June 1944). During this action two
                        pilots were seen to descend in parachutes over Magacionna Bay
                        and to land in the water. One landed aouta of Nefutan Point
                        and the other about salf way between Saipan and Tinish. AB
                        attempt was made to recover the latter pilot who was identified
                        to be Japanese. As there were still bogies on the reder acreen
                        it was not thought advisable so stop the ship and make a determined 
                        effort to recover the Jap bilot. Due to this fact, the
                        darkness, and his unwillingness to cooperate, the Jay was not
                        recovered.</p>
                    <p>8. Area 131 Dog was assigned to this ship for illumination 
                        during the night of June 18, 1944, and at 2251 commenced
                        firing starshells over designated area. The saise procedure was
                        used as on the previous night. A moss range of 8,500 yarda was
                        used. Starshell expendisure for this mission was 32 rounds.</p>
                    <p>9. The USS SAUFLEY want to General Quarters at 0913,
                        19 June 1944, while patrolling in Fire Support Sector #6 to rapel
                        possible air attacks. At 0921 opened fire on one Zero crossing
                        astera of the ship with 5th and 40mm batteries, (USS SAUFLEY AA
                        Action Report, dated 15 June 1944).</p>
                    <p>10. At 1540, on the same day, this vessel received
                        orders to bombard an enery troep concentration in area 115 Roger,
                        and at 1551 conseneed firing in designated area. Ceased firing
                        as 1624 as the SAUFLEY had been previously assigned a special
                        mission in Fire Support Sector #7. Total expenditure of ammunition 
                        was 48 rounds of AA Common.</p>
                    <p>11. The special mission assigned this ship was the
                        bombarêment of the New Airfield and revetment area on Tinian
                        west of Gurguen Point, using slow harassing fire. In addition
                        to this task a barge sweep was to be made along the west const
                        of Tinian giving particular attention to the barge concentration
                        in Tinism Harbor, This mission was to be divided into two
                        periods; first period to start at 1700 end last until 1900, and
                        the second period to start at 0400 the next morning and last
                        until 0600. AD 1707 commenced bombardment of airfield, and at
                        1721 made first barge sweep. Many small craft were seen in
                        Tinian Harbor, and the bay north of it. Total number was estimated 
                        to be about thirty, the largest of which appeared to be
                        small corvettes. The group of greatest concentration was taken
                        under fire at a mean range of about 11,000 yards. Although the
                        pattern appeared to streddle aout of the targets fired upon,
                        results were not aa good as expected. It is estimated that about
                        three barges were sunk in this phase. AB 1746 commenced bombardment 
                        of she airfield again. On this phase the rangefinder operator 
                        reported that ae saw what appeared to be two Bettya concealed
                        in the revetment 6296 to the west and south of the airstrip. Two
                        or three salvos were please in this area without observed results.
                        Another barge away was made into Tinian Harbor within 4,500 yards
                        of the beach at 1840, and the 40MM battery, as well as the 5"
                        battery was used. On large barge tied up alongside the dock was
                        set fire and when last seen was burning vigorously. Ageia many
                        salvos of the 5" battery were seen to straddle small barges without 
                        sinking them. Total expenditure of amounition on the airfield
                        was 63 rounds of AA Consos. 325 rounds of 40ml were expended on
                        the barge sweeps. AB 1911 commenced patrol off west coast of
                        Tinian on northerly and southerly courses keeping a strict watch
                        for any barges which might accempt to leave Tinian Marbor.</p>
                    <p>12. At 2250 orders were received to return to Fire
                        support Sector 6 until time for second period or special mission,
                        and at 0055 on 20 June 1944, commenced illumination of area 152
                        How as directed by Shore Fire Control Party. Later in the evening
                        area was shifted to 163 Yoke. Illumination of this area was maintained 
                        until the SAUFLEY was relieved on station by the USS NORMAN
                        SCOTT at 0230, 12 rounds of starshells having been expended.
                        After being relieved this ship set course for Fire Support Sector
                        #7 so complete second period of special mission previously assigned
                        to her.</p>
                    <p>13. At 0415 commenced bombardment of New Airfield on
                        Tinian for second period of special mission. Conseneed barge sweep
                        along coast lice at 0525. It and been decided after firing at
                        barges the previous evaning to employ a different control procedure
                        on the 5" battery for this phase. It was decided to act fuzes on
                        projectiles end to apply an up spot until about 50% of the projectiles
                        were air bursta and the remeinder detonating on impact. Much
                        better results were obtained using this procedure, as is was
                        practically impossible for the small craft to be straidled without
                        receiving some damage from the fragmentation of the air bursts.
                        The burge concentration area in Tinian Harbor was thoroughly covered
                        and when this ship cessed firing the barges that were still able
                        to anneuver were making frantie gestures toward the beach for 000⑉
                        coalment. At 0550 the airstrip was again bombarded for ten minutes.
                        The two Bettys which were thought to have been present the evening
                        before could not be seen on or near the airstrip during this last
                        phase. At 0600 returned to Fire Support Sector #6 for assignment,
                        having expended 40 rounds of AA Common on the airstrip and 57
                        rounds of AA Common on the barge sweep.</p>
                    <p>14. At 1235 received fire support assignment to
                        bombard area 164 Peter, essay troop concentration. Fire was
                        continued as called for by the Shore Fire Control Party until
                        an air strike on the same area started at 1310. AB which time
                        the SAUFLEY was directed to cease firing. 92 rounds of AA Common 
                        were expended.</p>
                    <p>15. AB 1409 commaneed bombardment of area 165 Charlie.
                        Ceased firing at 1420 having expended 28 rounds of AA Common and
                        2 rounds of Common, and having knocked out an enemy gun emplacement.</p>
                    <p>16. Area 166 Nan was bombarded consencing at 1435.
                        A spotting plane was furnished for this mission. After expending 
                        86 rounds of A4 Common and 18 rounds of Common, spotting
                        plane reported eneay gun emplacement destroyed and designeted
                        another target to be taken under fire.</p>
                    <p>17.  The new target was an enemy blockhouse in area
                        166 George. Commenced firing on this target at 1510 and continued 
                        firing for seventeed minutes. At the end of which time
                        the spotting plane ordered cease firing and reported that direct
                        hits had been made on the target. Expended 62 rounds of AA
                        Conson and 24 rounds of Common on this mission.</p>
                    <p>18. on the morning of 21 June 1944, ship was assigned
                        to bombard as eneay gun emplacement in area 108 George, but before
                        the SAUFLEY could get into position to fire on this area, without
                        erossing fire with another destroyer, the target was changed to
                        108 Love, enemy gun emplaceses firing into our troops. This
                        target was quickly located as the smoke from each shot rose above
                        the green follage and disclosed its position. Control BOOK this
                        target under direct fire at 0902 and destroyed it after firing
                        70 rounds of AA Conson and 11 rounds of Common.</p>
                    <p>19. After completion of mission in 108 Love, Shore
                        Fire Control Party reassigned target 108 George which was taken
                        under fire at 1019 and was also destroyed. 50 rounds of AA
                        Commonwere expended.</p>
                    <p>20. After completion of mission described in paragraph 19, 
                        the SAUFLEY was directed to report to the sereea
                        commander fur screening assignments.</p>
                    <p>21. On 26 June 1944, at 2208, while patrolling in
                        transport area screening station #19, the SAUFLEY went to General
                        Quarters to repel air attacks. At 2239 and at 2244 the
                        [] opened fire at a low flying plane making runs on this vessel
                        [] (USS SAUFLEY Action Report, dated 26 June 1944).</p>
                    <p>22. In compliance with orders the SAUFLEY left the
                        transport area at 1730 on 27 June 1944, and took station in
                        Fire Support Sector #7 to conduct harassing illusination and
                        fire on Tinian Town and surrounding area during the night.
                        After the first air raid the ship commenced assigned mission
                        at 2033. Mission was interrupted at intervals throughout the
                        evening as bogies closed this area. 42 rounds of starshells,
                        35 rounds of AA Common, and one W.P. projectile were expended
                        on this mission and three large fires were started in area.</p>
                    <p>23. On the afternoon of 29 June 1944, the SAUFLEY
                        was directed to report to Shore Fire Control Party in Fire
                        Support Sector 46. Mission assigned was the illumination with
                        starshells of the area 220 King as on previous missions of
                        this kind. After test firing at 1815 for the Shore Fire Control
                        Party to spot stars to desired location, the ship consenced
                        illumination at 1915, and maintained Illumination throughout
                        the sight. Expended 76 starshells on this mission.</p>
                    <p>24. At 1515 on 1 July 1944, the SAUFLEY relieved the
                        USS STOCKHAM in Fire Support Sector #5, and stood-by for Fire
                        Support missions. The ship was assigned mission to illuminate
                        area 251 Peter, and at 2024 commenced illumination as called
                        for by Shore Fire Control Party. Only eight stars were requested
                        during the night.</p>
                    <p>25. On the morning of 2 July 1944, the ship commenced
                        bombardment of area 221 Roger as directed by Shore Fire Control
                        Party. At 0900 fire was shifted to area 239 meen points of concentration 
                        Love and George and at 0925 fire was shifted to area
                        238 Xray, completing bombard ent at 1110. 554 rounds of AA
                        Common were expended. Shore Fire Control Party reported one
                        ammunition duep blown-up and all areas of enemy troop concentrations 
                        very effectively covered. The explosion of the ammunition
                        dump took place on about the third salvo, while firing in area
                        221 Roger, raising a large column of smoke.</p>
                    <p>26. At 1720 on 5 July 1944, the BABFLEY took station
                        in Fire Support Sector #5 and stood-by for fire support assignment. 
                        Later that evering the ship was directed to work with
                        Shore Fire Control Party 251 and 252 during the night, furnishing
                        illumination as directed. Considerable difficulty was experienced
                        by the two fire control parties in reaching an agreement as to
                        which area or areas this ship was to illuminate, but it was finally
                        decided that the ship would alternate illuminating area 262 Jig
                        for Shore Fire Control Party 251 and area 253 Victor for Shore Fire
                        Control Party 252. Illumination was commenced at 1922 and was
                        spotted to area 269 William by Shore Fire Control Party 251
                        and to area 267 Non by Shore Fire Control Party 252. Immediately
                        thereafter Shore Fire Control Party 252 reported that he would
                        not require illustantion until 0100. AB 1245 he was given a test
                        call but did not respond. Efforts were made to contact aim at
                        about 20 minute intervals throughout the night without success.
                        At about 0600 the cext sorning be was gives a test at which size
                        he CASO in loud and elear. Due to the fact that this ship was
                        unable to communient with Shore Fire Control Perby 252 it 11-
                        Indicated for dhore Fire Control Party 251 only, and maintained
                        ilummination as directed until 0530. 53 rounds of starshells
                        were expended.</p>
                    <p>27. That same morning the BAGFLEY wes again directed
                        to work with Shore Fire Control Party 252. Area 262 Easy was
                        designated and this ship consoneed firing at 0842 At 0915
                        the area was changed to 262 Charlie and the BABILLY opensi fire
                        on that area. At 0952 area 270 Peter was designated and fired
                        upon. After expending 340 rounds of AA Common on those aresa
                        the ship was ordered to desce firing at 1015.
                        1316 exercises
                        were resused with this ship opening fire upon deSignated ares,
                        270 Able. Target area was chan ed to 270 Fox at 1326 and then
                        back to area 270 Able at 1410. Area 269 Easy was then designated,
                        and after firing one salvo in this area, 270 Able was re-designated 
                        at 1422. By this sice the ship bad been set in dangerously
                        close to the beach. The agore Fire Control Furty HBS informed
                        that it would be necessary for the ship to cesse firing for a
                        above period of time in order to take station farther out from
                        the benefit on receiving this information the Store Fire Control
                        released the any from present exercises. 497 rounde of AA Compan
                        were expended.</p>
                    <p>28. on the afterno a of 8 July 1944. the SAUFLEY
                        relieved the USS MOOFOLD is Fire Support lector 44, and stood-by
                        for masign GBS. This only WSB directed to work with Shore Fire
                        Party 242 during the night illuminating the area deaig-
                        askad by him. Chore Fire Control Party 242 reported that he
                        decired illustention along the ridge line extending through areas
                        279 Take; 280 Fox, Able and Tare: 266 Victor, Roger and Man.
                        the first starshell WEB fired at 1930 and wea apotted to area
                        286 Reger as illumination over this 62.0 was considered to be
                        sufficient to illuminate the entire ridge. It was dedicad that
                        aix storahelle jor hour womle be satisfactory. At 2235 the
                        received orders to illusinate for Neval Cunfire Liason
                        Officer 80, expending not more then eight starshells per hour.
                        28 migat-be added this the number of starsholls on board would
                        not barmit firing at a creater rate than elent per house if il-
                        Nadisation was to be minutes throughout theatest. it 0051
                        Shore Fire Control
                        Party 82 came up on the circuit and directed the ship to
                        illuminate area 248 Jig. It was agreeable with Shore Fire
                        Control Farty 242 to give him three stare per hour and Ohore
                        Fire Control Party 82 five, so the ship proceeded to comply.
                        Shortly thereafter, Shore Fire Control Party 83 came in on
                        the circuit and requested immediate illumination in area 259
                        Item. He was told that the ship could furnish only eight stars
                        per hour and that the three of them would have to reach an
                        agreement. Chore Fire Control Party 82 decided to give his
                        stars to Shore Fire Control Party 83 during his emergency.
                        The ship consenced illuminating area designates by chore Fire
                        Control Party 83 at 0132. A short tise later Naval Liason
                        officer 240 case in on the circuit and requested illumination.
                        The situation was explained to him and be withdrew his request.
                        AS 0340 it was announeedthat capty illuminating projectile cases
                        were felling in area 233 Able and endagering our ONE troops.
                        The chart was checked and it was determined that these cases
                        were eosing from this ship when illuminating for Shore Fire
                        Control Party 83. After reporting this fact and receiving
                        instructions the ship cassed illumination at 0350 and took
                        station on the esst side of the island, commencing illumination 
                        again at 0405. Illusination was maintained until 0530
                        at which time the ship was released by Shore Fire Control
                        Party 83 and Shore Fire Control Farty 242. 71 starshells
                        were expended.</p>
                    <p>29. At 0800 the morning of 9 July 1944, the
                        gas SAUFLEY was directed by Shore Fire Control Party 242 to
                        take station to the eastward of Marpi Point, Caipan Island,
                        Marianas Group to standby for a fire support mission. AS 0823
                        this vessel was lying to on a northerly heading on assigned
                        station. At 0824 upon being assigned target area 292 Victor,
                        the ship went to General quarters and at 0840 the first salvo
                        was fired. From that point it was the purpose of the Shore
                        Fire Control Party to rake the castern section of the beach
                        from the a esigned area southward. This was accomplished by
                        left deflection apots. Results of this supporting fire were
                        unobserved by this vessel due to the point of impact being
                        placed on & reversed slops. AS 0918 upon order of Shore Fire
                        Control Party 242 fire was censed. This ship was told fire
                        would be resumed after the scheduled air strike. AB 0959
                        Shore Fire Control Party 242 reported that the planes would
                        make one more run on the area before firing would be commenced. 
                        at 1004 a new target area 288 Oboe, was designated
                        by Shore Fire Control Party 242 and the order to co mence
                        firing was given. Fire was withheld by this vessel as unidentified 
                        troope were observed in the vieinity of the assigned
                        area. This observation wes reported to Shore Fire Control
                        Party 242, and the order to proceed with firing was given at
                        1012. At 1019 this ship informed Shore Fire Control Party
                        242 of instructions, relayed by USS CONTROZAM from Shore Fire
                        Control Party 252, to cesse fire as it would endanger friendly
                        troops advancing to erect a flag upon the airfield. At 1023
                        Shore Fire Control Party 242 reported that they were investigating 
                        this report. At 1130 the ship was informed by Shore
                        Fire Control Party 242 that firing was completed for the day
                        but the ship was to resain in that area on a standby status
                        in the event of an emergency. The condition of readiness II
                        watch was set. It is concluded that these troops and those
                        observed from this vessel were one and the saze. At 1205 the
                        ship went to General Quarters on the order of Shore Fire Control
                        Party 242 to move into area 290 for the purpose of utilizing
                        automatic weapons against escaping enemy troops. Such action
                        was to be undertaken only upon order of the abore Fire Control
                        Party and when it was determined that the friendly troops were
                        not in danger of being subjected to this fire. Fire was held
                        by this ship on numerous enemy troops scattered along the lower
                        edges of the cliffs in the area as friendly troops were stationed
                        along the upper ledges. The enemy troops Beattered throughout
                        various crevioes and caves along the eliffs provided excellent
                        targets for the resigned type of fire. Friendly troops, however,
                        seemed to save control of the situation by means of smell arms
                        and grenade fire. At 1345 this ship was relieved of its assigned
                        mission by the was CONT and subsequently reported to the serean
                        consunder for further assignment, having expended 109 rounds of
                        AA Conson.</p>
                    <p>30. The capture and occupation of Saipan marks the
                        conclusion of this report. This vessel sustained no damage to
                        personnel or material with the exception of one five inch gun,
                        gun 14, being rendered inoperative in automatic train due to a
                        broken outboard coupling linkage and shaft connecting valve.
                        Coordination between CIC, gun control and plot was amouth throughout. 
                        The usual difficulties in communications were experienced,
                        mainly the breaking up of voice transmissions by other stations
                        on the same circuit. High frequencies seened to produce greater
                        voice level at night, thereby making communications with Shore
                        Fire Control Parties for the most part more difficult at that
                        time than during daylight hours. Personnel performed their daties
                        capably and efficiently and in and nanner sa to asse 11 possible
                        for the ship to respond readily to all tasks it was called upon
                        to perform.</p>

                            The visibility was poor and the transports were firing wildly.
                            First approach at 1900 was warded off by 40107 battery which discovered 
                            the plane, determined its identity, and opened fire. The
                            second attack at 1907 was also discovered and warded off by the
                            40MM battery. We were not under direct attack as the planes were
                            evidentally retiring from straffing the beach.</li>

                        <li>30. Sketch:  Our fighters were seen by rangefinder operator to scramble
                            with rold at about 12,000 yards. The leader of three enemy planes
                            still in formation and coming toward us was tracked. The first
                            burst caused two fighters to turn away from this ship into clouds,
                            but the leader(which control was tracking) turned toward this ship,
                            lost ultitude on the turn, then went out. Cease firing was given
                            when the target approached a formation of friendly fighters. Lookouts
                            reported seeing our fighters shoot down six enemy planes.</li>

                            to match in automatic train due to failure of valve control arm from
                            high speed synchro to TV3 control valve in train receiver regulator.
                            It was necessary to match pointers.</li>
                        <li>30. Sketch:  There were several planes in this raid. Eneay planes had been
                            in the area for about two hours many of which this ship tracked.
                            A few of the planes were lost as they dropped radar deception and
                            changed course. At 2238 an undetected plane paralleled the ship's
                            course to starboard at an estimated altitude of one hundred feet.
                            The 40mm battery fired a few rounds at this plane, but due to poor
                            visibility and rapid beering change fire was ineffective. it 2239
                            the maia battery picked up one enesy plane flying high and coming
                            through a deception area, The burata caused the plane to change
                            course, climb and increase speed. At no time was the plane seen
                            therefore effectiveness of fire could not be determined.</li>

                        At 1730 Love 26 Pearuary 1944, this ship got
                        underway from Fort Furvis, Florida Island as a part of Tusk Group
                        34.2 occuposed of the following sipe; Group "A" # U.S.S. GOIMAY,
                        U.S.S. U.S.S. PRINGLE and U.S. ZATON. Group "a",
                        U.S.S. WALLER, (Captain F.Peterson, Ogemander Destroyer squadron 
                        Twenty-Two, Officer in Centital commund) RESIDENT
                        SAUFLEY and PHILIP and proceeded to Treasury Islands
                        where all ahipe fueled. Upon completion Group "A" proceeded
                        toward at. George Channel in compliance with purt 1 of reference
                        (b). Group "3" departed from Treasury Islanda at 1300 29 February 
                        1944 and arrived west of Cape st. George at 2250 the same
                        day.</p>
                    <p>2. At this time the formation couse to ocurse 090 (T),
                        reduced speed to 15 knots and made all preparations to bombard
                        Cape St. George Radar Station. Order of chips in column was:
                        U. SAILIER, U.S.A. SANFLEY, U.S. and U.S.S. PHILIP,
                        distance between ships, 1000 yards. At about 2305 the SALLER
                        accuraceed firing end at 2307 this ship opened fire followed very
                        shortly thereafter by the other shipe in column. The opening
                        zunge and bearing for the SAUFLEY was 6950 yards bearing 0150 (T).
                        This ship ceesed firing at 2317 the target range was 8250
                        yarás bearing 3340 (T) having exended 150 rounds of AA Compon.
                        No spotting plane wee available lecause of weather conditions.
                        Therefore results of this bombardment are unknown although shells

                        were unfavorable for spotting. The ailes were heavily overesst

                        control is recommended when target even is obscured from gun
                        control and when no spossing plane is available.</p>

                    <p>On the evening of 6 January 1945, the U.S.S. SAUFLEY was
                        a screening unit of Attack Group Able of the Lingayen Attack
                        Force then enroute to Lingayen Gulf and scheduled to arrive in
                        the transport area the morning of 9 January. Attack Group Baker
                        was steaming five miles ahead of this group. Air cover was
                        provided by escort carriers of Task Group SEVENTY SEVEN POINT
                        FOUR.</p>
                    <p>No enemy surface forces were known to be in the immediate
                        vicinity. There were, however, strong possibilities of attack
                        by enemy submarines and aircraft. Reports of contacts on
                        enemy aircraft were frequent. Ship was in condition of readiness
                        I-3 and material condition A was set.</p>

                    <p>Communications were excellent. There were no material
                        failures. A listening watch on the Fighter Director and Combat
                        Air Patrol circuits proved to be of value to Air Plot in that
                        it supplemented own ships radar search. It was found that this
                        type information, when relayed to Control and Air Defense,
                        stimulated interest among lookout personnal thereby promoting
                        greater efficiency.</p>
                    <p>During the air attack on 8 January rader interception analyzed
                        as being produced by a Japanese air search ruder operating on a
                        frequency of 155 megacycles was detected. This, however, aid not
                        interfere with own ship's air search radar.</p>
                    <p>Coaching control on target by means of automatic bearing
                        designation direct from the air search radar PPI cursor
                        provided to be more efficient than the hand target designation
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Distinguishing between bogey and friendly aircraft Was S
                        made difficult in many instances because certain friendly
                        aircraft failed to show IFF indications. This was partially
                        overcome by the listening watch on the Fighter Director circuits
                        together with a running geographical plot of the location of the
                        Combat Air and Anti-Submarine patrols.</p>

                    <p>Casualties to personnel consisted of small shrapnel wounds
                        to two machine gunners causing no serious injury. All hands
                        performed in an excellent and commendable manner.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>1.  On the night of 14 February 1944, ship picked
                        up single bogey on port quarter at 2319, ship went to general
                        quarters. Bogey was tracked in to 7 miles before it retired.
                        At 2340 ship set Condition 1 Easy.</p>
                    <p>2. At about 0135, 15 February 1944, picked up
                        bogey bearing 0920, distance 17 miles. Bogey was closing
                        formation and ship went to eneral quarters at 0140. Bogey
                        closed to 71 miles before retiring on a southeasterly course.
                        Shortly thereafter another bogey was picked up bearing 3200,
                        distance 18 miles. Bogey approached formation sharply on
                        the port bow, circled the formation to port and came in for an
                        attack up moon, dropping approximately six bombs near the convoy 
                        at about 0230. From this time until dawn several bogies
                        remained in area of the three transport groups, only one of
                        which attacked our group. This bogey made his attack after
                        dropping occulting flares along and ahead of the track line.
                        After dropping the flares he circled the formation from port
                        to starboard at a distance of about 8 miles and made an attack
                        from the rear of the formation, dropping approximately five
                        bombs at about 0243 near the convoy.</p>
                    <p>3. At about 0300 an attempt at radar deception was
                        noted.  This fact was established after plotting the pip which
                        revealed no apparent motion and had the characteristics described 
                        in enclosure (A)</p>
                    <p>4. At 0643 without previous radar detection by us
                        the Task Force was attacked by about six VALS. We attribute
                        the cause for not detecting the enemy planes to the fact that
                        our IFF is non-directional and that there were 42 friendly
                        planes covering the Task Force which made it practically impossible 
                        for us to detect a bogey. This ship saw two planes
                        definitely shot down.</p>
                    <p>5. During the night attacks all planes coming within 
                        gun range and making definite attacks on our formation
                        approached from our port quarter and up moon. In the morning
                        it is believed that all attacking planes came in from the north
                        and west over Green Island. The only attacking plane which
                        came within a clear firing sector and gun range crossed astern
                        of this ship and was being chased by a P-39. Due to the above
                        remarks and policy of not shooting at snoopers unless they were
                        making a definite attack this ship did not fire at any planes
                        throughout the operation.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">ENCLOSURE (A)</p>

                    <p>The deception pip was picked up bearing 180° (T)
                        at a range of 23 miles and persisted for about fifteen minutes.
                        There was land on the ap proximate reciprocal bearing of the
                        deception pip and at about the same range; however the radar
                        operator was convinced that the pip was not a side echo. The
                        deception pip differed from the ordinary plane pip in the
                        following respects:</p>

                    <p>1. The deception pip's amplitude was less than that of
                        the ordinary pip and did not reach saturation.</p>

                    <p>2. The deception pip was noticably greater in width
                        than the ordinary pip.</p>

                        Destroyer Division FORTY-ON'S got underway from PURVIS DAY at
                        1540, 22 August 1943, to proceed up the slot and intercept one
                        Japanese heavy cruiser and three destroyers reported by our
                        aircraft to be off northwest tip of BOUGAINVILLE on course 160°,
                        speed 28 knots. Commender Destroyer Bquadron TWENTY-ONE on NICITOLAS
                        was O.T.C., Commander Destroyer Squadron THINTY-TWO was on SAUFLEY.</p>
                    <p>2. SAUFLEY and RENSHAN formed column 7000 yords storn
                        of Destroyer Division FORTY-ONE. CONY was 11000 yards estern
                        of
                        this unit because of engine trouble. At 2300 while nor
                        th
                        of
                        KOLOMBARGARA, o surface reder contact was reported on two objects
                        by Commender Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-ONE. Targeta were reported
                        on course 060°, speed 5 knote, then OR 325°, apood 5 knots. This
                        unit was ordered to attack and advised to use torpoloes. Speed
                        was reduced to 25 knots and the GONY closed to standard distance.
                        The reported targets were never picked up on radar by any ships
                        of this unit. They could not be seen as the night was dark and
                        overcast. Reported targets may have been rain squall or water
                        schoes.</p>
                    <p>3. At 2312 the SAUFLEY, RENSHAW, and OCNY proceeded
                        to patrol between VELLA LAVELLA and CHOISEUL BAY, with Destroyer
                        Division FORTY-ONE patrolling further to the westward. 0009 on
                        the 23rd, bogies were picked up by so rader and were continually
                        on the screen until 0400. During this time there were never less
                        than five bogica on the screen. Moonrice was at 0043. The ship
                        was then about 20 miles south of CHOISEUL BAY. The planes ap⑉
                        parently operated individually but circled the ships almost
                        continuously, maintaining ranges of 10000 - 20000 yords. AB 0110
                        commenced making smoke and zig-regging radically at 30 knots, the
                        ships astern following in a locse column.</p>
                    <p>4. At 0206 a plano came in to 3000 yards and main
                        battery commoneed firing, using full rader control. No results
                        were observed. Planes were dropping float lights in paire of
                        54563 red and white flares around the formation. AS 0235 BG radar reported 
                        a plane easing in over the RANSRAW, range 1500 yards. At
                        0237 this plane come in from port bow and crossed to starboard,
                        flying very low, passing about 200 yerds ahead of ship. BAUFLEY
                        was turning right to avoid torpedoes. Plane was taken under fire
                        by 40mm and 20mm guns at about 600 yerds range when he would be seen.
                        A 20mm was seen to hit as he passed abead but evidently inflicted
                        LLO serious danage to plane. About 0240 an underweter explosion
                        was heard. The plane was apparently an Mitaubishi type 97, single
                        engine landplane.</p>
                    <p>5. At 0300 commenced steering southeasterly courses
                        to proceed to TULAGI. it 0305 a plane came in low on the starboard 
                        bow and dropped a torpodo about 200 yards from ship.
                        Torpedo WES seen hitting the water. 40mm and 20mm's opened
                        fire but did not hit. Both engines were backed full and rudder
                        put over hard left. At 0310 another plane cause in on starboard
                        bow, the first warning being the sound of his engine. He was
                        taken under fire by 40mm's and 20mm's and was hit by 20cm after
                        be had passed over to port side. This please dropped a torpedo
                        about 200 yeards off starboard bow. The rudder was put over hard
                        right and starboard engine backed full. Observers report seeing
                        torpedo wake pass estern about 20 yards.</p>
                    <p>6.  Planes seemed to fly at on ultitude low enough to
                        moise it difficult to pick them up on SC radar and high enough that
                        they could not be picked up on SG continuously. when the
                        planes
                        approached low to attack they were al ways picked up on SO radar,
                        however. CIC kept the bridge and machine guna continually informed 
                        when low flying planos were approaching using relative
                        bearings. On all but the third attack warning was given before
                        the plane was in to torpedo release range.</p>
                    <p>7. It is believed that the SAMPLE was the only ship
                        attacked, the other two destroyers being in the evoice sereen astern.
                        40mma and 20mm aft were hampered by amoica nost of the time,
                        the forward 20mma usually spotting the planes at about 500 yeards
                        and opening fire first. Planes continued to orbit the formation
                        until C400 but none attacked.</p>
                    <p>8. A total of 92 rounds of 5"/38 antiaircraft continue
                        communition with XX XVIII, Mod. 2 and 3 time fuzes, 96 rounds of
                        40mm, and 450 rounds of 20mm was expended.</p>

                    <p>1. The SAUFLEY in company with Taste Group THIRTY-
                        ONE point SIX left KOKUMBORA, GUADALOANAL at 0400, 30 August
                        1943, in accordance with Commander Task Force THIRTY-ONE'S
                        secret despatch 290040 of August, to proceed to BARAKOMA, VELLA
                        LAVELLA. Tank Group consisted of RENSHAW, CONY, DENT, MOKSAN
                        and L3T's #398, 341 and 353. Commander Task Group, Captain W.
                        R. COOKS, U.S. Navy, Commander Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-TWO,
                        was in the SAUFLEY.</p>
                    <p>2. At 1830 on the 30th just after sunset, bogies
                        were picked up at 12 miles bearing 350° (T). Destroyers commenced
                        making smoke and patrolling et 25 knots. At 1850 no bogies
                        could be picked w and destroyers returned to normal screening.</p>
                    <p>3. At 0145 on the 31st, five IGI's joined Task Group.
                        While in MURDA STRAIT, at 0250, two bogies were picked up at 15
                        niles coming in from the south. Planes never did come in close
                        however, and circled 5-10 miles to westward, heading north at
                        0305. Exhaust flames could be seen at times. The night was
                        very dark and it is believed that Task Group could not be Been
                        except at a very close range. All batteries had been ordered not
                        to fire on planes unleas they were very close to ship.</p>
                    <p>4. At 0417 a bogie was picked up at 6 miles and
                        stayed in the vicinity until 0450. ranging between 2 and 10
                        miles. At 0435 plane passed directly over the formation at
                        about 1000 feet. Plane's engine could be heard as it passed
                        overhead and exhaust floses could be seen. At 0443 the CONY
                        took the plane under fire but apparently did not hit.</p>
                    <p>5. At 0600 the DIRT and MOKEAN left formation to
                        proceed to BARAKUMA and unload before LST's and ICI's arrived.
                        At 0600 Task Group arrived at BARAKOBA and destroyers commenced
                        patrolling 2-4 miles offshore at 20 knots. At 0839 the DONY
                        reported a large group of bogies at 43 miles bearing 290°(T).
                        At this time 16-20 fighters from MURDA were providing air coverage. 
                        The morning was bright and clear with very few high clouds.
                        At 0842 the SAUFLEY picked up bogies at 34 miles bearing 2600 (T)
                        ship went to full general quarters and was manouvered redically
                        at 25 knots.</p>
                    <p>6. At 0851 speed was increased to 30 knote and ct
                        0653 LCI's were underway, having completed unloading. Destroyers
                        prepared to escort IGI's to RENDOVA. At this time bogles were
                        25 miles away bearing 230°(T). Dogies were supparently orbiting
                        to the south eloeing slowly and at 0658 were reported by CIC at
                        18 miles bearing 190°(T). At 0859 a dive bember was seen diving
                        on ship from starboard bow, slant range about 500 yards, position
                        angle about 450. Plane was taken under fire by forward 20mm's
                        but was not hit. Several boabs landed on port side smidships
                        about 20 yards from ship. Three other dive bombers followed in a
                        loose column and bombs landed about 10-20 yerds from ship on
                        both sides. Machine gunners apparently kept firing at the leading 
                        dive bouber and did not take others under fire until they
                        had pulled out. Planes came within about 400 feet of ship.
                        Five inch and 40mm batteries did not open up until Disness had
                        pulled out of dives and were heading north. A total of 9-12
                        planes participated, attacking only the three destroyers.</p>
                    <p>7. Places were apparently Aichi 99 dive bembers a a it
                        is believed that each plane dropped three bombs, one about 500
                        pounds and two about 100 pounds. Bombs were released at about
                        1000 feet. Bombo had delay fuzes, otherwise fragment damage
                        would have been considerable. Bomb fragments struck the ship but
                        caused no casualties emong personnel except for three men who
                        received miner scratches. One fragment penetrated the hull six
                        feet above the waterline art leaving a two inch hole end other
                        frequents struck after gun mounts, torpedo tubes, and forward
                        stock resulting in negligible damage. Three rounds of 5" 125
                        rounds of 40mm and 420 rounds of 2 Qmm were fired at the dive
                        bombore with no apparent hits. Our fighters engaged them as
                        they headed north and one dive bomber was seen to crash by northeast 
                        VELLA LAVELLA.</p>
                    <p>8. LCI's were escorted to within 15 miles of REDIDOVA.
                        At 1215 destroyers headed for BARAKOMA at 30 knots to escart LST's,
                        having received word by voice radio that they would be unloaded by
                        1400. AC 1336 LST's cleared beach and Task Group proceeded at 10
                        knots through GIZO STRAIT, destroyers patrolling at 25 knots. At
                        1445 a torpedo plane was reported over GANGNOGA ISLAND on the
                        fighter circuit. other bogies were also reported but turned out
                        to be friendly.</p>
                    <p>9. At 1934, while in MURDA STRAIT, a bogie WAS picked
                        up at 42 miles, bearing 295° (T), closing rapidly. At 1945 bogie
                        was 11 miles, bearing 300°(T). At 1950 MUNDA Airfield opened up
                        with searchlights and antiaircraft fire. Plane was apparently a
                        seerch plane as it followed our route down es for es MUNDA.</p>
                    <p>10. Test Group arrived at KUKUM, GUADALGANAL at 1430

                        despatch 240258 of August. Captain W. R. COOKE, U.S. Navy,
                        Commander Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-TWO and Commander Task Group
                        THIRTY-ONTS point SIX embarked in SAUFLEY. SAUFLEY also had
                        Fighter Director Group on board.</p>
                    <p>2. Full general quarters set at 1913 that evening
                        and modified at 1940. Upon se rader report of two objects bearing 
                        327° (T) at 14000 yards, full general quarters was set at 2155,
                        then modified at 2203 as objects were identified as friendly shipe.</p>
                    <p>3. At 0252, 26 August, se radar operator reported
                        bogie beering 255°(T), range 19 miles. Set Condition I. Bogie
                        withdrew apparently not having made contact with this group.</p>
                    <p>4. At 0320 bogie picked up on sc reder bearing 290°(T),
                        range 29 miles approaching formation. Set Condition I as bogle
                        was closing rapidly. Bogie cane directly in toward the shipa.
                        At 0340 commenced firing at a range of 2800 yards and bogie withdrew. 
                        At this time the bogie gave the correct emergency identification. 
                        "Cease Fire" was given just after plane dropped flores,
                        after having fired twenty-Sive rounds 5"/38 antiaircraft common
                        with no observed results. At no time did a friendly signal appear 
                        on so rader screen, and visual identification of plane was
                        impossible. After "cease firing" was given, the plane was tracked 
                        out to ten miles bearing 225 (T) and then lost.</p>
                    <p>5. According to Commander Task Force THIRTY-ONE'S
                        despatch 260748 of August, this plane was one of our own Black
                        Cats which was foread down as a result of damage caused by sunfire 
                        of this group.</p>
                    <p>6. At 0607 bogie reported bearing 237° (T), distance
                        5 1/2 miles and the order was given to cover LST's with funnal smoke
                        screen. Ceased making smoke at 0617. At 0620 antimircruft fire
                        was observed at BARAXOMA and esearting destroyers commenced making
                        smoke. nb 0630 ane anemy plane was sean diving on LST's apparently 
                        having come in above and behind our fighter coverage before maleIng 
                        his dive. This ship opened fire Immediately and expended 30
                        rounds 5"/38 antiaircraft common with no observed results. Enemy
                        plane withdrew low over the water after having dropped one bomb
                        which aid no damage to any shipe in group. At 0637 cessed making
                        smoke. Ships at this time were starting north through GIZO STRAIT.</p>
                    <p>7. During the remainder of the operation and during
                        the return from BARAKOMA to KOKOMBONA, Task Group THIRTY-ORE point
                        SIX had several se reder contacts but at no time aid bogies close
                        the formation.</p>

                    1.  The SAUFLEY proceeded in accordance with Commander
                    Third Fleet's despatch 170032 (NPM 996) in company with Commen der
                    Destroyer Squadron TWENTY-TWO in the WALLER, with PRINGLE,
                    Commander Destroyer Division FIFTEEN in the LANG, and STACK, with
                    orders to act as covering force for landing operations in the
                    Enogai, New Georgia area. At 2150 an enemy snooper plane was
                    picked up on the SC radar and one or more snoopers remained with
                    this formation continuously until about 0415. The moon was full
                    and sky was partly cloudy, visibility was excellent. At 0112
                    Love the covering Black Cat reported three (3) enemy destroyers
                    dead in the water at latitude 07-58 South, 156-58 East. At 0132
                    proceeded. to investigate contact report. At 0138 visual contact
                    made with three (3) apparently small destroyers believed to be
                    approximately three hundred (300) yarde off shore. Due to the
                    target's proximity to land neither the SG nor the FD radars were
                    able to pick up these targets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    2.  At 0148 commenced firing 5" main battery at a range
                    of five thousand five hundred (5500) yards, on course 255 degrees
                    (t), speed thirty-four (34) knots, thereafter changing course
                    radically by turn signals received over T.B.S. The left hand
                    ship was taken as the target. Enemy's proximity to shore made
                    him difficult to see clearly, despite excellent visibility.
                    Spotting was done by the stereo rangefinder operator. An eight
                    hundred (800) yard continuous ladder was used in one hundred (100)
                    yard steps. What was believed to be three (3) white smoke
                    soreons from smoke floats appeared about one thousand (1000)
                    yards northward of the targets, who were first on a northerly
                    and then turned to a southwesterly course, making approximately
                    twenty-five knots. At 0152 ceased firing, having expended one
                    hundred thirteen (113) rounds of 5" ammunition. No firing from
                    the enemy ships was observed. Two (2) hits were observed by the
                    rangefinder operator and Control officer. The enemy destroyers
                    remained close inshore and were approaching the entrance to
                    Blackett Strait. The SAUFLEY retired on a northwesterly course
                    with the WALLER, to resume patrol of Kule Gulf, having reached
                    a position well down in the Vella Gulf and approaching the region 
                    where our own PT boats were operating. At no time during
                    this engagement were PD radar ranges or bearings on the target
                    obtainable. Instead, the director was kept on the target by the
                    coaching of the storeo rangefinder operator, who was able to see
                    the target at all times, while the redar reage to land, minus
                    an estimate of the target's distance from land was used.
                    Although the SG radar picked up the target shortly before the
                    signal to commence fire was given, C.I.C. was unable to get an
                    accurate plot due to shock caused by sun fire, especially when
                    the forward guns were firing well abaft the beam to port. Both
                    before and after commencing fire we were illuminated by several
                    flaros from the anoopers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    3.  Throughout the ovening mooper planes were on the
                    SQ radar screen, shadowing the formation at ranges of five to
                    ten miles. At 0245 what appeared to be two (2) signal flares,
                    green and red, were dropped ahead while the sir attack was in
                    progress. At about 0310, while on patrol at twenty-five (25)
                    knots outside Kula Gulf, a stick of three (3) bombs landed estern,
                    from port to starboard, at a distance of about two hundred (200)
                    yards. Commenced radical manouvering generally on easterly
                    courses. At 0320 commenced firing at plane caming in, rence
                    four thousand (4000) yards. At 0325 forward guns ceased firing,
                    and speed was changed to twenty (20) knote. At 0326 after guns
                    ceased firing. Expended seventy-three (73) rounds of 5" ammunition. 
                    At 0329 speed changed to twenty-five (25) knots. At 0347
                    after guns commenced firing at approaching plane. At 0349
                    ceased firing. Expended eighty-four (84) rounds of 5" ammunition.
                    At 0400 commenced firing at plane coming in from starboard,
                    range eight thousand (8000) yards. At C404 ceased firing, expended 
                    one hundred nine (109) rounds of 5** ammunition. The times
                    given above are approximate. This was the plane seen by several
                    members of the crew, to explode and disintegrate. During the
                    above period two (2) more sticks of three (3) or four (4) bombs
                    were dropped close aboard this ship. One stick landed ahead and
                    about one hundred fifty (150) yards on starboard bow. The other
                    stick landed about fifty (50) yerds estern, straddling the wake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    4.  Throughout this air action, full radar control was
                    used, the director being coached on by the SC rader. The performance 
                    of the so equipment was hampered by nearby land masses and
                    gunfire shock of the preceding engagement which necessitated retuning 
                    of the suplexing unit and the transmitter. other undertermined 
                    damage to the so rader was sustained which limited its
                    maximum plane re 60 to about ten (10) miles, and generally lowered
                    the effectiveness of the equipment. Mark XVIII Mod 3 fuxes were
                    used throughout due to proximity to land. It in believed that
                    about six (6) plenes participated in the attack, ocessionally
                    making their runa in groups of about three (3), but for the most
                    part, coming over singly, preferably from over land at an el titude
                    of from twelve thousand (12000) to thirteen thousand (13000) feet.
                    It is further believed that from twenty (20) to twenty-four (24)
                    bombs were dropped, the main target being the WALLER, SAUFLEY,
                    PRINGLE section. It is understood that a total of three (3)
                    planes were reported to have fallen by persons on the LANG. One
                    of these were claimed by the PRINGLE, one by the WALLER, and it
                    is believed that the SAUFLEY fire accounted for the third.

                    <p>
                    This report covers the USS SAUFLEY's participation in
                    the naval operations surrounding the capture of Balikpapan from
                    the rehearsal exercises on 23 June 1945 to this ship's departure
                    from the objective area on 19 July 1945.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Own forces consisted of the units composing the Attack
                    Group in addition to the Support and Covering Group. Air cover
                    was provided by Royal Australian Air Force and the 13th Air Force
                    augmented for the initial phase of the operation by three (3)
                    carrier escorts with their planes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The SAUFLEY's mission was to screen and escort the
                    Attack Group during the sortie from the staging area at Morotai
                    and during the advance of the group toward Balikpapan. At the
                    objective area the mission consisted of providing anti-submarine
                    and anti-aircraft protection for the shipping in the transport
                    area. When not thus occupied, the ship was called upon to provide 
                    fire support and night illumination for the advance of the
                    troops ashore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Enemy forces of any considerable strength were not
                    known to exist. Attack by enemy submarines, suicide and Motor
                    Torpedo boats were considered to be both possible and probable.
                    A possibility of suicide attacks from the air also existed.
                    Mines, both enemy and Allied, were known to exist in the vicinity
                    of Balikpapan, and the progress of the minesweeping units were
                    made the subject of information disseminated to participating
                    units.

                    Attack Group Flagship prior to departure summed up and drove
                    home the doctrines and aspects of what was set forth in detail
                    by the operation plan. Benefit was derived from this and seemingly 
                    necessary information was further disseminated to key
                    personnel of this command. Recognition instruction on current
                    Allied aircraft expected to be seen in the area was given to
                    personnel in exposed stations. Control Officers and Gun Captains
                    were instructed by means of photographs and charts on the terrain
                    expected to be seen should direct fire become a necessity. All
                    hands were instructed not to throw floating trash over the side
                    which would hamper any air-sea rescue operations. Communication
                    personnel were instructed to eliminate call ups after good communications 
                    had been established and to draft outgoing voice
                    traffic in such a manner as to enable the recipient to answer
                    "affirmative" or "negative". Lookouts were cautioned to be on
                    the alert for floating mines as well as the possibilities of
                    attacks by suicide boats. As an extra protection against this
                    form of attack, armed sentries were stationed on deck during
                    such times as the ship was anchored. Speeds of two knots or
                    below were to be used in areas where the possibility of acoustic
                    magnetic mines existed; SAUFLEY did not knowingly enter any
                    such areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    With the exception of an anti-aircraft sleeve firing
                    practice enroute, no firing was done by this ship until July 2nd.
                    Bogies had been reported and picked up by own radar enroute but
                    had repeatedly turned out to be friendly planes. At 1514 on
                    July 2nd, having been in the A/S screen outside of the transport
                    area, this ship received its first fire support mission. Fire
                    was directed at an AA gun position Northeast of Balikpapan
                    Town, with the aid of a spotting plane from the USS PHOENIX,
                    until 1705. At 2008 of the same day, harassing and interdiction
                    fire were provided until 2030 when illumination with starshells
                    was called for until 0351 the following morning. During this
                    time the SAUFLEY assisted in retrieving the lost sweep gear of
                    the YMS 314. Illumination ceased when it was reported that enemy
                    planes were in the area. At 0625 on the morning of July 3rd, a
                    plane, presumed to be hostile, was observed to fall enveloped in
                    flames. At 1150 a counter battery fire mission was ordered but
                    before opening fire the SAUFLEY was relieved by the WALLER and
                    ordered to replenish ammunition. At 1855 on July 4th, the
                    SAUFLEY took station astern of the USS BELL which was patrolling
                    off the mouth of the Manggar River, Borneo. Both ships were
                    awaiting orders to open fire in support of own troops, which
                    had advanced to the Eastern edge of the Manggar Airstrip. At
                    0004 on July 5th, the previously arranged harassing fire commenced 
                    in an area ahead of the Australian front lines. This
                    was repeated at 0400. At dawn enemy planes were in the area.
                    At 0812 call fire was requested to destroy a heavy machine gun
                    pit 1000 yards ahead of own troops. Fire was later shifted by
                    the SFCP to a coast defense gun and continued until a scheduled
                    air strike began. The following evening the SAUFLEY received a
                    call fire mission to destroy enomy AA guns in approximately the
                    same area. At 1842 fire was shifted to another coast defense
                    gun. White Phosphorus was used, primarily for burning out
                    personnel and foliage. On the morning of July 6th at 0932, AA
                    guns and another coast defense gun were taken under fire. These
                    were worked on until 1349. Own air strike interfered for an
                    hour during which time fire was checked. In the evening at 1922
                    call fire was requested to silence twin 27 millimeter guns which
                    were believed to be shelling own troops. They were reported to
                    have been silenced at 1957. At 0027 on July 7th illumination
                    was provided to aid in preventing a counter attack North of the
                    Manggar Airstrip. This was followed up with harassing fire for
                    ten minutes at 0124 and again for five minutes at 0600. The
                    SAUFLEY, having been relieved by the USS PHILIP, proceeded to
                    take on ammunition. Fire support duties were again resumed in
                    the evening when call fire was provided on a gun position commencing 
                    at 1527 and continuing for one hour. The last firing
                    mission was call fire against another machine gun position commencing 
                    at 1745. Fire was ceased at 1754 and two hours later
                    the SAUFLEY commenced patrolling a screening station.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Until retirement from the objective area on July 19th,
                    duties were divided between screening the transport area and
                    awaiting a fire support assignment at anchor in fire support
                    station off the Manggar River. On July 19th, the SAUFLEY, in
                    company with the PHILIP, departed for Morotai escorting the
                    USS CHEPACHET.

                        Weather enroute to the objective area was fair with winds
                        between 270° true and 3400 true having an average velocity of
                        4.5 knots accompanied by cumulus and alto-cumulus clouds. At
                        the objective area the wind direction varied between 180° true
                        and 3350 true with an average velocity of 8.0 knots. The sky
                        for the most part was covered with cumulus and alto-stratus
                        clouds. Intermittent rain squalls with lowered visibility were
                        experienced frequently. This, however, did not hamper or interfere 
                        with the operations of this ship. All times are Item times.

                    The performance of own ordnance equipment was excellent. 
                    Two starshells burst prematurely. All starshells were
                    fired from the same gun with fuze setters in automatic. Illuminating 
                    projectiles which prematured were assembled with Mk 18
                    Mod 2 fuzes, Lot # 296. In both instances the burst occurred
                    1000 to 1500 yards from the ship, the time of flight being
                    approximately two seconds.

                        Fire discipline was good and gunnery communications
                        presented no problems.

                        From reports received from Shore Fire Control Parties
                        it is believed, for the most part, that this ship's fire was both
                        timely and effective.

                        Training deficiencies were evident during the AA

                        No battle damage was inflicted on this vessel by the

                        All shore bombardment was conducted by indirect fire.
                        Navigation was greatly simplified by the use of special hydrographic 
                        charts having scales of 1:36,000 and 1:72,000. The
                        1000 meter grid which was overlayed on these charts enabled fine
                        pinpointing of target areas. The scales simplified the use of
                        the ship's DRT in that the settings were less complicated than
                        those used with the 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 scale U.S. Army grid
                        maps. Local current conditions made the underway indirect firing
                        problem interesting and when a definite set and drift were established, 
                        target course and speed were set into the computer.
                        The dissemination of information in regard to mine fields and
                        swept areas was superior to any previously experienced by this
                        command in other operations.

                    <p>
                        Communications were both well organized and well handled.
                        It is believed this was due in part to the briefing given at the
                        conference prior to departure for the objective area. It seemed
                        that circuit discipline was of an unusually high standard. This
                        ship experienced one material failure when a TBL transmitter
                        broke down during a fire support mission. The circuit, however,
                        was transferred to another transmitter, TBK with speech input
                        modulater, until the necessary repairs could be effected. The
                        Australian BLO assigned this vessel handled all communications
                        with the Shore Fire Control Parties in an efficient manner, thereby 
                        releasing ship's personnel for other duties in CIC, and avoiding 
                        the embarassment of not always understanding the Australian
                        version of the King's English.

                    <p>
                        Air and surface search radars were used continuously
                        and effectively. The well executed movement plan included in the
                        operation order provided CIC with timely information concerning
                        incoming and approaching convoys or resupply echelons thereby
                        reducing to a minimum the number of "skunk" reports. Plane
                        tracking by both air search and fire control radars presented
                        little or no problem in this area.

                    <p>
                        The only radar pulse not easily identified as Allied
                        during the operation was picked up by RCM gear at 0400 (I), on
                        1 July, in latitude 01-07-00 S, longitude 117-10-10 E. It was
                        a frequency of 86.0 megacycles with a pulse repetition rate of
                        approximately 50 cycles, a pulso width of 17.5 or 18.0 microseconds 
                        and an indicated train rate of 4 R.P.M's. No data on
                        enemy or Allied radar held by this vessel comformed to all of
                        these particular specifications, although it seems likely that
                        the gear was the British type 281 being used by the Australians.
                        The only respect in which the received signal failed to correspond 
                        to the type 281 was train rate, a factor which cannot be
                        determined with precise accuracy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion: (1) It is recommended that firing ships
                        in all operations requiring shore bombardment be complemented
                        with Bombardment Linison Officers. Greater understanding of the
                        problem ashore and speedier execution of requests are gained
                        thereby. (2) During heavy rain squalls similar to those experienced 
                        several times during this operation, all Shore Fire Control
                        Party circuits are blocked by rain and static. At one time
                        during a cloud burst the Shore Fire Control Party urgently tried
                        to request harassing fire in a previously spotted enemy area.
                        Communications were not established because the Shore Fire Control 
                        Party radio was flooded. It is suggested that if harassing
                        fire is needed during such periods a systematic use of pyrotechnics, 
                        as a secondary means of cummunications, be employed
                        by the Shore Fire Control Party. (3) Vessels due for night
                        illumination missions should be provided with an increased allowance 
                        of starshells in order to fulfill frequent and large demands
                        on this source.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In regard to supply, it is the wish of this command
                        to express appreciation for the efficient cooperation shown by
                        the U.S.S. POLLUX in respect to prompt issue of General Stores
                        and the U.S.S. AREQUIPA for equally prompt issue of fresh provisions. 
                        The only important shortages felt by this vessel were
                        condensed milk and yeast, which were not available in sufficient
                        quantity in the staging area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The foresight and planning of this operation is fully
                        appreciated by this vessel, especially in regard to replenishment 
                        of fuel, ammunition, the relieving of ships on fire support
                        duty, and the dissemination of mine sweeping data immediat ely
                        prior to the assault.

                    <div><u>PART I</u></div>
                    <p>
                    A. On the morning of 1 February 1945, the USS
                    SAUFLEY was returning from a night retirement from Nasugbu
                    Bay in company with Commander Task Group SEVENTY EIGHT POINT
                    TWO in the USS SPENCER soreened by the SAUFLEY and the USS
                    CONYNGHAM. Steaming on base course 0830 (T), the SAUFLEY
                    sighted what appeared to be a small P.T. Boat bearing 083° (T),
                    distance 5000 yards. on reporting this target to Commander Task
                    Group SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWO the SAUFLEY was directed to investigate. 
                    Upon investigation the target appeared to be one
                    of the "Q" Boats frequently reported in this area. It was maneuvering 
                    radically at high speed. The SAUFLEY closed the target
                    and opened fire first with the 40 MM battery and then with the
                    main battery. Nine minutes later the target was completely
                    destroyed; the only remaining evidence being a gasoline slick
                    and scattered indistinguishable debris.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Subsequent to this the SAUFLEY was assigned a
                    station in Fire Support area Able off San Diego Point in Nasugbu
                    Bay and delivered thirteen salvos into grid positions as assigned
                    by the Shore Fire Control Party. Results were unobserved as the
                    spotter was not in a position to control the fire. Direct fire,
                    however, was delivered into the area at the base of a heavily
                    wooded cliff until ordered to cease fire by the Shore Fire
                    Control Party who released the SAUFLEY to the screen.
                    </p>
                    <div><u>PART II</u></div>
                    <p>
                    A.  The SAUFLEY was operating as a unit of Task Unit
                    SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWO POINT EIGHT which was the screening unit
                    for Task Group SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWO, the Nasugbu attack force.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    B.  Prior to this date this vessel had left Leyte Gulf
                    under orders issued by Commander Task Force SEVENTY EIGHT to
                    escort Commander Task Unit SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWELVE POINT SIX
                    in the CGC INGHAM to the San Antonio-Castillejos-San Felipe Area of
                    Southern Luzon, Philippine Islands. Enroute the SAUFLEY was detached 
                    on 30 January to investigate and assist a plane reported in the
                    water off Agutaya Island. Upon arrival in that area this assignment 
                    was taken over by U.S. Army Crash Boat P-493 and the SAUFLEY
                    rejoined the INGHAM in the Mindoro Straits. At 0800 the morning of
                    31 January the SAUFLEY entered the San Antonic-Castillejos-San Felipe
                    Area of Southern Luzon, was released by Commander Task Unit SEVENTY
                    EIGHT POINT TWELVE POINT SIX and reported to Commander Task Group
                    SEVENTY EIGHT POINT THREE in the USS MOUNT MCKINLEY for duty.
                    At 0940 the same morning the SAUFLEY got underway as escort for
                    the tug, USS GRASP, enroute to Nasugbu in accordance with orders
                    issued by Commander Task Group SEVENTY EIGHT POINT THREE. Upon
                    arrival at Nasugbu on the afternoon of 31 January, the GRASP
                    proceeded to the transport area and the SAUFLEY relieved the
                    USS RUSSELL in the screen. At 1830 the same day Commander Task
                    Group SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWO in the USS SPENCER got underway
                    with the SAUFLEY and CONYNGHAM as screen for a westward night
                    retirement from Nasugbu Bay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    C.  In the first action the SAUFLEY'S mission was
                    to investigate and destroy the target if identified as enemy.
                    In the bombardment the SAUFLEY'S mission was to deliver call fire
                    as directed by the Shore Fire Control Party in that area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    D.  Our forces at the outset of the action consisted
                    of Task Group SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWO in Nasugbu Bay consisting
                    of CGC SPENCER as flagship of Commander Task Group SEVENTY EIGHT
                    POINT TWO, Task Unit SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWO POINT ONE the Transport 
                    Group composed of APD'S, LCI's, LSM's, LST'S, Task Unit
                    SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWO POINT SIX the Support Unit, Task Unit
                    SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWO POINT SEVEN the Control Unit, Task Unit
                    SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWO POINT EIGHT the screen consisting of the
                    destroyers FLUSSER, SHAW, CONYNGHAM, CLAXTON, and SAUFLEY, Task
                    Unit SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWO POINT NINE the Minesweeping Unit and
                    Task Unit SEVENTY EIGHT POINT TWO POINT TEN the Beach Party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    E.  Enemy forces encountered consisted of the one
                    "O" Boat although it was reported that others had been in the
                    area during the previous night.

                    In conclusion it may be stated that "Q" Boats
                    are definitely a menace in restricted waters as their detection by
                    radar is difficult. The shore bombardment was of such brief
                    duration that concluding remarks or recommendations would be of
                    no basic value.
