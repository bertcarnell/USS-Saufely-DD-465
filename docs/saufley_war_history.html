        <p class="text-center"><u>SHIPS HISTORY - U. S. S. SAUFLEY (DD465)</u></p>

        <p>
        The USS SAUFLEY, built by the Federal Shipbuilding Com-
        pany, Kearny, New Jersey, was commissioned in the United States
        Navy on 29 August 1942 by Rear Admiral E. J. MARQUART in a
        ceremony conducted at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Lieutenant
        Commander Bert F. Brown, U.S. Navy, assumed command.
        </p>
        <p>
        After commissioning, the SAUFLEY scent the month of September 
        fitting out at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the month of
        October on shake down training out of Casco Bay, Maine. Upon
        completion of several East-coast milk runs, she got underway
        from Norfolk, Virginia, on 9 November 1942, for the South Pacific.
        </p>
        <p>
        Arriving at Noumea, New Caledonia on 2 December 1942,
        the SAUFLEY re orted to Commander South Pacific Area for duty.
        Six days later, this ship arrived off Lun. a Point, Guadalcanal, 
        with troop transports. During the rest of the month,
        the SAUFLEY operated with a Cruiser Task Group, and as screening 
        ship for another transport unit to Lunga. On 2 and 3 January, 
        the SAUFLEY bombarded enemy positions near Kokumbona,
        Guadalcanal, and then continued screening transports for another
        week.
        </p>
        <p>
        After completion of Gunnery Exercises from 18 January to
        11 February off New Caledonia, the SAUFLEY want to Guadalcanal.
        Between 20 February and 4 March, this vessel made nine trips
        to the Russell Islands including the original echelon. The
        SAUFLEY was not only transport and covering vessel, but also
        a tug towing LCT's on several occasions. The next ten days
        were spent on anti-submarine patrol off Guadalcanal. On
        15 March the SAUFLEY joined the SS PETER SYLVESTER en route
        to Noumea. The next day two bombs were dropped near the
        SYLVESTER by an enemy plane.
        </p>
        <p>
        The last eight (8) days of March were spent alongside
        the USS RIGEL in Hevennah Harbor, Efate, New Hebrides. April,
        May, and June were divided between exercising with the fleet
        out of Havannah Harbor and escort duty in the New Hebrides ex-
        cept for one week's availability alongside the USS DOBBIN in
        Sydney, Australia in early May.
        </p>
        <p>
        The next quarter was spent in support of the operations
        in the middle Solomons. On 3 June, the SAUFLEY participated
        in the first bombardment of the Shortland Islands.
        </p>
        <p>
        While searching for barge traffic off Kolombangara a
        week later the SAUFLEY was ordered to investigate a short range
        surface contact, shortly thereafter identified as a submarine.
        This ship fired two torpedoes and all batteries before the
        sub submerged. A sonar contact was made and two depth-
        charge attacks followed. The submarine was believed sunk.
        </p>
        <p>
        on 12 July, the SAUFLEY, operating with a cruiser task
        force, bombarded Munda Point, silencing several shore batteries.
        Flare dropping planes were taken under fire and the SAUFLEY
        got its first plane.
        </p>
        <p>
        Six nights later, the SAUFLEY and four destroyers were
        attacked by six enemy planes. Seven sticks of bombs were
        dropped close aboard this ship. Three planes were shot down
        of which this ship was credited with one. Full radar control
        of the 5"/38 battery was used.
        </p>
        <p>
        The occupation of Vella La Vella began on 15 August 1943.
        The SAUFLEY screened the first echelon of LCI's and assisted
        in repelling four to six enemy planes. Six underwater explo-
        sions rocked the ship. The next night, the SAUFLEY was ordered
        to assist in the "Action off Vella La Vella", but was recalled
        when the beachhead was brought under heavy air attack. During
        the attack this ship closed the flaming LST 396 to within 700
        yards, and lay to in order to pick up survivors. All rescue
        nets were lowered and the whaleboat was put in the water. The
        Torpedo Officer, Lieutenant James Marion Coulling, USNR, of
        48 S. Long Beach Ave., Freeport, Long Island, New York, was in
        charge of the boat. In the face of both a heavy air attack
        and flying debris from the LST, he courageously carried out his
        task. The SAUFLEY rescued 93 men including 10 officers and
        the SC 1266 picked up the rest of the crew. The only fatality
        was a pharmicist's mate who died shortly after he was picked
        up by the SAUFLEY.
        </p>
        <p>
        The next morning the SAUFLEY was attacked by 8 to 10 dive-
        bombers coming down sun. The machine guns fired at two planes
        which dropped two bombs close aboard, while the main battery
        was firing at two planes attacking the beachhead. The gunnery
        officer slewed on the attacking planes after he saw the bombs,
        but by then they were almost out of range. He then shifted to
        a single bomber which was also going out on the starboard side.
        After a right spot was applied, a 5" burst hit the plane which
        circled and crashed close to the beach.
        </p>
        <p>
        About 1600 that afternoon a single plane attacked the
        USS PHILIP astern of this ship and was taken under fire by all
        batteries as he pulled out. He dropped three bombs off the
        port quarter and then attempted to pull out of his dive pass-
        ing astern from port to starboard. Smoking, he dropped close
        to the water and passed up the starboard side at about 10,000
        yards. A friendly fighter reported that it was shot down just
        before "Cense Fire was given. The machine guns got the credit.
        </p>
        <p>
        Shortly afterwards three planes with target angle 090
        were seen over the beach. The 40MM machine guns took one under
        fire and the main battery another. Friendly fighters reported
        that both planes that were seen to drop behind a hill were
        actually shot down. During these attacks the destroyers were
        laying smoke screens to cover the landing craft.
        </p>
        <p>
        On 22. August the SAUFLEY, RENSHAW and CONY proceeded
        up the slot to interrupt the Tokyo Express. Early in the morn-
        ing of the 23rd, enemy planos were continuously present. The
        three destroyers were laying smoke screens, and the SAUFLEY,
        leader of the column, was the only ship attacked. Several
        planes were fired on. At 0305 a torpedo was launched which
        was avoided by an emergency back full and radical maneuvor-
        ing. Shortly thereafter, another torpodo passed 20 yards
        astern. Captain Brown had the conn.
        </p>
        <p>
        on 26 August enroute from Kokumbona, Guadalcanal to
        Barakoma, Vella La Volla, the SAUFLEY was with a re-supply
        ochelon which was bombed by several enomy planes. No damage
        was done to any ship. The SAUFLEY was on a similar mission
        of 31 August when 4 out of 10 to 12 planes attacked this ship.
        About 6 bombs were dropped within 10 to 20 yards of the fantail,
        causing nogligible damage to the ship. The SAUFLEY fired with-
        out results.
        </p>
        <p>
        Enroute from Purvis Bay, Solomon Islands to Espiritu
        Santos, the SAUFLEY established a sound contact on 15 September.
        After the fourth depth-charge attack the submarine surfaced
        and was taken under firo with both 5"/38 and machine guns.
        A number of hits were observed. The sub disappeared, but
        shortly thereafter an underwater explosion was heard. The next
        morning after the fifth attack, there was an oil slick $ , 000
        yards long, and 500 yards wide. Also observed were several
        large wooden fragmonts and pieces of deck grating and the
        strong odor of diesel oil. This ship and plane 41 of VP-23
        were given equal credit for probably sinking the sub.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Gunnery Officer during the Volla I,a Volla campaign
        was William J. Martin, Lieutehant, USN, of Farmer City, Illinois.
        His ability to get on targets, control the battery, and make
        effective spots under air attack are ample expressions of his
        quick reactions, calmness, and intelligence, which paid off in
        Jap planes shot down.
        </p>
        <p>
        The rest of September was spent in the New Hebrides,
        including a five-day availability alongside the USS HITNEY.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SAUFLEY, in company with the USS RADFORD and
        USS GRAYSON, participated in the destruction of 24 (50-75) feet
        long Japanese barges. Return machine gun fire from Jap barges
        did no damage to any of the ships. The first of October, with
        RADFORD, GRAYSON and LAVALLETTE, this ship destroyed 9 of 10
        enemy barges off Kolombangara, Now Georgia Island; two wore de-
        finitely sunk by this ship. Later that night the ship was under
        bombing attack; a near bomb put the SC radar out of commission
        and some thirty fragments penetrated the hull and superstruc-
        ture. Thirteen (13) men were injured, including the Doctor,
        Lieut. Claude R. HUFFMAN and Engineering Officer, It. H.V. HARDING.
        </p>
        <p>
        The plane which made this attack was not taken under
        fire, as instructions had been issued not to fire on sing-
        le bogeys during the barge hunt. Iater that night the
        SAUFLEY opened fire on a bogey and observers report that the
        plane was seen to crash in the water.
        </p>
        <p>
        After two unsuccessful barge-hunting missions and es-
        cort duty in a convoy to Vella La Vella, the SAUFLEY went to
        Noumea, New Caledonia, for five days availability includ-
        ing two days in dry-dock.
        </p>
        <p>
        On October 27, returning from the initial landing on
        Treasury Islands, the formation was bombed by a single plane
        without results.
        </p>
        <p>
        The next three months the SAUFLEY was an escort and
        screening ship in the Bougainville campaign. On 11 November
        1943, this ship proceeded independently southwest of Bou-
        gainville to pick up a downed pilot. Upon returning to Em-
        press Augusta Bay, after having rescued the pilot, this ship
        avoided the attack of five enemy bombers which had closed to
        4,000 yards by ducking into a rain squall. The night of the
        17th when the USS MC KEAN was sunk during a torpedo attack,
        the SAUFLEY screened the USS SIGOURNEY and USS TALBOT, which
        were engaged in picking up survivors.
        </p>
        <p>
        On December 6, 1943, Lieutenant Commander Dale E. Coch-
        ran, U.S. Navy, relieved Commander Bert F. Brown, U.S. Navy,
        as Commanding Officer.
        </p>
        <p>
        Between December 12th and 19th, the SAUFLEY temporarily
        interrupted its convoying activities with a seven-day avail-
        ability in Sydney, Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
        This ship then resumed escorting echelons to Bougainville
        and continued until February 2, 1944, when she started a
        seven-day availability alongside the USS WHITNEY in Purvis Bay.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SAUFLEY participated in the first two echolons to
        Green Island. on the night of February 14-15, until after
        dawn, the formation was attacked by several groups of enemy
        planes with negative results.
        </p>
        <p>
        In a destroyer sweep off New Ireland, the SAUFLEY bom-
        barded Cape St. George radar station, Borpop, and Namatanai
        Air Field, during the night of February 29 and morning of
        March 1st. Several shore batteries were silenced off Manarou
        Island, after this ship received some noar misses.
        </p>
        <p>
        During the period from March 11th to March 16th, this
        ship participated in bombardment of Japanese positions and
        joint activities with PT boats in Empress Augusta Bay,
        Bougainville.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SAUFLEY served as a hospital evacuation ship after
        the landing at Emirau Island by taking 8 injured personnel
        back to Purvis Bay. She then returned to Emirau as part of
        a covering force which patrolled in the area most of April.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SAUFLEY established a sound contact on April 7th
        and dropped depth charges. After the second nine-charge
        pattern was dropped, two underwater explosions were heard
        and felt. Four hours later about 4 miles upwind from the
        last contact, a diesel oil slick appeared on the surface
        of the water, By sunset this slick was measured and found
        to be 14 miles long and 3/4 of a mile wide. The assessment
        was that there was "insufficient evidence".
        </p>
        <p>
        on May 4th, the SAUFLEY left for Pearl Harbor where she
        engaged in battle exercises and had 5 days availability along-
        side the USS PIEDMONT in preparation for operations with the
        Fifth Fleet.
        </p>
        <p>
        On June 1, 1944, the SAUFLEY left Pearl Harbor with
        the Northern Attack Force for the Saipan Operation. Enroute,
        outside of Kwajalein, on June 11th, this ship conducted an
        anti-submarine attack until relieved by the USS FRANKS. Re-
        sult was an oil slick 3,000 yards long by 1600 yards wide.
        Arriving at Saipan on June 16th, the SAUFLEY covered the
        landing of reinforcements.
        </p>
        <p>
        During the period from June 17th to August 8th, this
        ship engaged in 23 shore bombardments and 10 starshell mis-
        sions on Saipan and Tinian. The total ammunition expondi-
        ture was 4,000 rounds of five inch 38 calibor shell, 400
        starshells, and many rounds of 40 millimeter and 20 milli-
        meter as well. The number of assignments alone shows how
        effective the firing was. Neutralization of enemy troop
        concentrations, destruction of a corvette and several small
        craft in Tinian Town, one plane, the runway and several build-
        ings of an airfield, an ammunition dump, gun emplacements,
        caves, blockhouses, and other installations, harrassment of
        Tinian Town and several groups of enemy troops, and starshell
        missions to prevent infiltrations of our lines were all ef-
        fectively accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
        As an example of the extreme strain and hardship imposed
        by this campaign, Lieutenant James W. Beebe, USNR, of 1060
        Roanoke Road, San Marino, California, the plotting room off-
        icer, lost twenty pounds during this period. His well trained
        and efficiently organized crow showed the results of his
        careful, intelligent, untiring supervision.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SAUFLEY also engaged enemy aircraft several times
        during this operation. On the afternoon of the 17th, the
        machine guns opened fire on two Tonys retiring over this
        ship from a strafing attack on the beachhead. No hits were
        observed and no damage was sustained. The next evening, the
        main battery and machine guns took 3 Tonys of. a group of
        more than 12 under fire, chasing them into several Helleats,
        who shot down at least six planes. On June 19th, one Zero
        took off from Tinian and proceeded to make a surprise attack
        on this ship. Machine gun fire soon dissuaded him, and
        shortly afterwards a Hellcat accounted for hin. On June 26th,
        the main battery, using full radar control, set fire to a
        Betty. Whether the plane was downed was not definitely as-
        certained.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SAUFLEY departed from Saipan on August 12, 1944,
        for Pearl Harbor and ultimately San Francisco. She arrived
        at the Bethlehen Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, San Fran-
        cisco, California, on August 31st, after having been under-
        way except for rearming, refueling and provisioning for 92
        days. This ship had Navy-Yard availability for the next six
        weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SAUFLEY left San Francisco on 19 October 1944. Af-
        ter participating in training exercises both at San Diego and
        Pearl Harbor, the SAUFLEY reported to Commander Seventh Fleet
        whose forces she joined at Leyte Gulf on 20 November.
        </p>
        <p>
        For the next eleven days, the SAUFLEY operated both with
        the main body of the covering force and on patrol stations.
        Many red alerts combined with a negligible fighter cover of
        several P-38's a few hours a day gave ships an excellent
        opportunity to destroy enemy planes. On the 22nd and 24th
        enemy planes were taken under fire without results.
        </p>

        Shortly before noon on the 27th the main covering force
        was attacked by about 15 planes. While the main battery shot
        down a dive-bomber on the port bow at which several ships were
        firing, the machine guns shot down a dive-bombor on the star-
        board bow, a sure kill. Shortly thereafter, the main battery
        tracked a torpedo plane coming in with target angle zero and
        opened fire at maximum effective range. The plane began to
        smoke at 6,000 yards and crashed into the water at 4,000 yards.
        Many hits were observed.
        </p>
        <p>
        on the night of the 27th, accompanied by Destroyer
        Division FORTY THREE, this ship proceeded to Ormoc Bay, and
        participated in the first destroyer sweep of Ormoc Bay for
        the purpose of destroying enemy shipping which night be
        attempting to land roinforcements on the West Coast of Leyte.
        Our predetermined speed was 30 knots. Visibility was extrome-
        ly poor. Slowing speed to 20 knots SAUFLEY fired 120 rounds
        of 5"/38 AA Common on predetermined target with unobserved
        results. Upon completion of bombardment, the division made
        a sweep westward into the Camotes sea. At 2313 a PBY on
        patrol reported an enemy submarine approachine Ormoc Bay.
        Soon thereafter the RENSHAW picked up a surface target which
        was immediately confirmed by the SAUFLEY; range was 6 miles.
        The RENSHAW opened fire followed by the SAUFLEY at a range of
        3 miles. Submarine was taken by surprise and commenced
        radical maneuvers. Starshell illumination afforded optical
        gun control. Soon after all ships commenced firing 40MM,
        the submarine returned fire with machine guns. Fire was ceased
        as it became apparent the WALLER was going to ram the sub-
        marine. The WALLER circled the submarine and the Division
        Commander reported that the submarine sank stern first. All
        ships were given credit for definitely sinking the submarine.
        </p>
        <p>
        on 29 November the SAUFLEY was patrolling between
        Homonhon and Dinagat Islands at the entrance to Leyte Gulf.
        The U.S.S. AULICK was in the same station about 4 miles away.
        The condition was "flash white" and the ceiling was less than
        1,000 feet. At 1752 the AULICK commenced firing with her
        machine guns. Immediately thereafter, a VAL was seen making
        a run on the SAUFLEY. The ship turned hard left and went to
        flanking speed. This deception plus the fact the plane was
        hit with ship's gunfire resulted in the plano with bomb load
        intact crashing close aboard to starboard, causing an explosion
        which inflicted considerable damage to starboard side forward.
        All engines were stopped to prevent further damage to hull in
        case of flooding. The ship again went to flank speed as a
        Zero commenced run from port quarter. The port machine gun
        battery put the Zoro in flames, the ship was turned hard right,
        and the plane crashed along the port side. About three minutes
        later another Val approaching from astern was taken under fire
        as ship turned left. Plane released its bombs which flew be-
        tween the stocks exploding close aboard to starboard, causing
        injury to personnel in that area. This Val was believed to be
        hit as it flew over the ship, caught fire and crashed 50 yards
        off the starboard bow. All three planes cane down in about
        60 degree dives through the very low ceiling so that extreme
        visual range was loss than 2,000 yards in each case. They all
        strafed, but without success.
        </p>
        <p>
        One man was lost over the side and twenty-six men received
        minor injuries; none, however, being hospitalized. The injured
        were:

        <p>
        As a result of the attack, the SAUFLEY suffered considerable
        hull damage on the starboard side of the bow just below the
        waterline and ninor damage on the port side of main deck and
        superstructure deck below the bridge. The watertight integrity
        of the shell was not impaired. The AULICK was under attack
        by three suicide planes at the same time, and suffered con-
        siderable damage and loss of life.
        </p>
        <p>
        According to all available information, this was the
        first concerted suicide attack on a picket ship. Persistent
        firing by the alert, well-disciplined machine-gun crews com-
        bined with well-tined hard turns and changes of speed were
        an unbeatable combination. The Commanding Officer, Connander
        Dale E. COCHRAN at the conn should be credited with saving
        the ship by naneuvering while Lieutenänt (jg) Daniel B.
        MICHIE, Jr., USNR of Washington Lane and Panther Road, Rydal,
        Penna., Machine Gun Control Officer and Gunner B. H. BISHOP,
        U.S.N., 501 Street, Bentonville, Arkansas, Assistant
        Machine Gun Control Officer undoubtedly sparked their gun
        crews to do the most damage. Individual acts of heroism were
        connonplace.
        </p>
        <p>
        On 2 December, the SAUFLEY departed for Manus Island,
        Admiralty Islands to effect repairs of battle damage.
        </p>
        <p>
        This ship proceeded independently fron Manus on 1 Jan-
        uary 1945 to pick up intelligence photographs at Hollandia,
        Now Guinea and rendezvous with the Lingayen Attack Force
        enroute to the objective area.
        </p>
        <p>
        During evening twilight on the 8th, the fornation was
        attacked by about 8 planes, 4 of which were seen to be shot
        down by friendly fighters. One Val on our port quarter was
        taken under fire by all batteries. He circled astern in a
        steep dive so that the main battery had to check fire because
        the bearing was not clear. The machine guns followed him
        down to a position angle of 15. degree when check fire was
        given. At about the sane time, the transports connenced fir-
        ing. HC crashed about 100 yards astern of the nearest trans-
        port. The evaluation was at least a sure assist because of
        our heavier and more accurate fire.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SAUFLEY screened the initial landing at Lingayen
        in Lingayen Gulf, Luzon on 8 January. Shortly after sunset,
        this ship simultaneously took two planes under fire without
        results.
        </p>
        <p>
        The next norning, a Val cane in from the port quarter,
        circled the ship, and then made a shallow suicide divo from
        the port bean. Many hits by the mchine guns were observed,
        and the plane crashed in the water close aboard to starboard.
        </p>
        <p>
        on January 12, the SAUFLEY fired at two planes without
        results that afternoon, this ship departed from Lingayen and
        proceeded to Leyte Gulf as screening ship for returning trans-
        ports. The next day, enroute, the SAUFLEY rescued one man
        who had been thrown overboard by a suicide crash in the
        U.S.S. ZEILIN.
        </p>
        <p>
        After escorting a convoy to Morotai and then back to
        Leyte, the SAUFLEY escorted the CGC INGHAM to the Subic Bay
        beachhead, and arrived there on 31 January. The same day,
        this ship proceeded to the Nasugbu landing to serve as screen-
        ing vessel. On the morning of 1 February the SAUFLEY sank
        an attacking "Q" boat. Later the same morning, this ship
        neutralized a Japanese pocket of resistance with the main
        battery.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Connanding Officer was Officer in Tactical Connand
        of a resupply echelon to Nasugbu on the 7th and 8th. The
        SAUFLEY evacuated 8 wounded to Mindoro.
        </p>
        <p>
        In Subic Bay, on 12 February Lieutenant Connander Fran-
        cis W. SILK, U.S. Navy relieved Connander Dale E. COCHRAN,
        U.S. Navy as Conmonding Officer, U.S.S. SAUFLEY.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SAUFLEY participated in the initial landings and
        the occupation of Mariveles, Bataan and Corregidor Island.
        After the landing at Mariveles on the 15th this ship delivered
        counter battery fire on Caballo while covering ninesweepers.
        That night, this ship supplied interdiction fire on the roads
        leading to Mariveles. The next day, the SAUFLEY covered the
        landings on Corregidor.
        </p>
        <p>
        Between the 18th and 26th of February, expending 2700
        rounds of 5"/38, 70 starshells, and about 2500 rounds of 40MM
        ammunition, the SAUFLEY engaged in 10 shore bonbardments and
        3 starshell harrassing missions on Corregidor.
        </p>
        <p>
        An active Japanese 75MM, numerous caves and pill boxes,
        a Q-boat, and two barges were destroyed, and many enery troop
        concentrations were neutralized. On one day alone, the
        spotter on the beach reported that this ship's fire had sealed
        up 20 caves and killed 159 Japs who had already come out of
        the caves.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SAUFLEY steamed through mined waters several times
        and on one day anchored about 500 yards off Monkey Point to
        deliver the fire the Army needed. The Commanding officer,
        Lt. Condr. F. W. SILK, USN, was commended by Connander Des-
        troyer Division 46 for the excellent performance of his ship
        during this operation.
        </p>
        <p>
        on 1 March, the SAUFLEY conducted a pre-H hour shore
        bombardment of Tilic Town, Lubang Island, Philippine Islands.
        This ship was flagship for the Lubang operation.
        </p>
        <p>
        After a four-day availability alongside the U.S.S.
        DOBBIN in Subic Bay, the SAUFLEY went to Mindoro to join the
        Zanboanga attack force as a screening ship. During the Zan-
        boanga operation, the SAUFLEY on 16 March, screened the
        Basilan Attack Unit and bombarded Lanitan Town before the
        landing.
        </p>
        <p>
        On 24 March, the SAUFLEY became flagship of the
        Commander Sulu Attack Group and the Senior Officer Present
        Afloat at Zamboanga. Until 21 April, this ship was anchored
        at Zamboanga except during the Sanga Sanga and Jolo operations
        in which the SAUFLEY served as flagship, screening vessel,
        and covering vessel. The landing on Sanga Sanga was made
        on 2 April. That afternoon, the SAUFLEY and several other
        vessels near the beach were fired upon by Jap machine guns.
        No counter battery fire was delivered, because the extent of
        our patrols was not known.
        </p>
        <p>
        From 8 April to 11 April the SAUFLEY participated in
        the attack on Jolo. On the 9th, this ship delivered a pre
        H-hour bombardment. The next day, this ship silenced a Jap-
        anese gun emplocement during a bombardment.
        </p>
        <p>
        From 22 April to 2 May, the SAUFLEY was anchored in
        Tawi Tawi Bay, Sulu Archipelago with Connander of Sulu Attack
        Group on board in charge of sweeping operations.
        </p>
        <p>
        This ship then went to Morotai, Halmahera Group and
        spent the next two weeks escorting convoys between Leyte
        and Morotai. The SAUFLEY received tender availability along-
        side the U.S.S. WHITNEY from 21 May to 28 May to effect struc-
        tural repairs. On 3 June the SAUFLEY loft Morotai with a
        convoy to Brunci Bay, British North Bornoo. This ship screened
        unloading operations at the objective area on 15 June and
        then proceeded to the Miri-Lutong area to cover nine-sweep-
        ing operations. Three days later the SAUFLEY left for Morotai.
        </p>
        <p>
        On 26 June, the SAUFLEY departed with the attack force
        for Balikpapan. She served both in screening and fire-support
        assignments. During 7 shore bonbardments and 2 star-shell
        missions, this ship expended over 1000 rounds of 5"/38 annun-
        ition. Many machine gun and coastal-defense-gun enplacements
        were destroyed, and several harrassing and interdiction
        missions were accomplished. This ship departed for Morotai
        on 19 July.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SAUFLEY went to Leyte from Morotai and remained in
        the Leyte area until 5 August when the ship left for Ulithi,
        Caroline Islands to report to Connander Marianas Group for
        escort duty because of the submarine menace in the area at
        that time. The last week of the war was spent escorting ships
        between Ulithi and Leyte.
        </p>
        <p>
        on 25 August the SAUFLEY reported to the Connander
        Yangtze Patrol Force in Subic Bay for duty. This ship arrived
        at the Saddle Islands, China on 9 September. The Connanding
        Officer, Lt. Condr. F. W. SILK, was in charge of nine sweepers
        clearing the approaches to the Yangtze River nouth. This ship
        served as mine destruction vessel as well. On 26 September,
        the SAUFLEY left for a week's liberty in Shanghai-- the first
        liberty since October, 1944.
        </p>
        <p>
        The SAUFLEY then went to Tinghai, Chusan Archipelago
        to assist the Chinese Governor to effect the surrender of
        2700 Japanese. Officers of the SAUFLEY made a thorough in-
        vestigation of all installations and then insured that the
        orders given by their Commanding officer, Lt. Condr. SILK,
        to the Japanese were carried out. All large guns were ron-
        dered inoperative, and all portable arns and annunition
        were assembled and put under guard. The Japs thenselves were
        interned in a Fishing School and the buildings near the
        airstrip.
        </p>
        <p>
        Between 26 October and 4 November, the SAUFLEY had a
        recreation period and was the first DD to have a Ship's Party
        in Shanghai.
        </p>
        <p>
        During November the SAUFLEY served as Harbor Entrance
        Control Vessel at the mouth of the Yangtze and made one nail
        run between Okinawa and Shanghai.
